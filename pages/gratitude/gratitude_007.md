#### Accommodations

I am grateful for the accommodations that have been made for our family medical situation. I enjoy being able to support everyone in their appointments, and making sure that everyone is able to get where they need to be every day. Without these kind of accommodations it would be impossible to keep everyone healthy. Some career paths would not have allowed this as working in person at a specified time is crutial.

My job allows me to work almost any hour that I can. There are meetings and events that I need to be in person for, but those are only a small portion of the work. The one thing that I have struggled with since our move is being productive at home. The new house is a completely different environment than I am used to. There are lots of distractions and **SLOW** internet. The internet speed is so slow that I tend to get distracted and do other things when something that is usually executed within a few ms takes 30s or more. I know it sounds rediculous but when every step takes this much extra time it gets very distracting. It is something that I just need to learn to work with, and keep a project ready to work with little to no internet at all times.
