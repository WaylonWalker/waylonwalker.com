title: Gratitude 126

We are getting ghosted by sellers again, they are really cramping the
style on this whole gratitude journal.  I am very grateful that we have
a great team on our end trying to get us into a house that we love
before we are sent out of this one.  They are really doing everything
that they can to help us, it's just hard when there is no response from
the other end.  This house really meets so many of our wishes, many
wishes that we didnt even realize that we had.  It's hard to look at
other houses, especially when most are more in the city and more
expensive.   We still have our hopes up.  We really want a house that
our whole family can love and we can grow together in without worry
about where we are going to be living next.
