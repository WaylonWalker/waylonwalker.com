Really the last day before it all starts back up.  Today, I totally
thought it was a work day.  Got dressed and everything, popped out the
laptop and realized it was a floating holiday.  Well it was a good dry
run, cause after a few weeks off getting up and at em on top of getting
everyone their things they need in the morning I was not getting going
at the normal time.

Today Ayla and I had a fantastic coloring session.  We each made some
heart eye emojis to give to each other and they turned out awesome.  She
even cut them out for me.
