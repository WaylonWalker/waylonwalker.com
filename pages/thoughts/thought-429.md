Staically makes creating OG images so easy, you can just pop this in your <head> section with some og tags.

``` html
    <meta name="og:image" name="og:image"
        content="https://cdn.statically.io/og/{{post.title}}" />
    <meta name="twitter:image" name="twitter:image"
        content="https://cdn.statically.io/og/{{post.title}}" />
    <meta name="og:image:height" content="640" />
    <meta name="og:image:width" content="1280" />
```
