Last night I took Dobby for his first bike run, and he absolutely loved it!  He
was running alongside with a big smile the whole time.  We took it nice and
easy our first time on the sidewalk, didn't go too fast and paid attention to
not wrap any fire hydrants or anything.  I am ready to head out with him again,
now is the time.
