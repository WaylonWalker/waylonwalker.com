A productive Sunday, that sums up the day pretty well.  Yard mowed and trimmed,
cars washed, and camps went to.  After D&D camp Wyatt wanted to go through a
walk through the surrounding woods, as hot as it was we had a fantastic time.
There was a swift breeze under the dense canopy of trees overhead providing a
much needed relief from the direct sunlight.  We followed a busted old sidewalk
through the woods occasionally wondering if we would ever find it again.
Occasionally wondering if turning back would be faster to get back or if we
should keep moving forward to finish the journey.
