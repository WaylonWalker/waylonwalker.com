the racked up 4 framework mainboards sound wild.  connected with usb4 and 5gig ethernet.  they said they can run big models quantized down from 600Gb to within the 512GB limit they have.  This seems wild to bring this level of capability to such a low price point.  It will be really cool to start to see demos come out.
