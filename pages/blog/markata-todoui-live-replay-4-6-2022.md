Super fun steam Broadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/waylonwalker

We worked on markata todoui, a command tui trello board written in python using only markdown files to store the data.  I love markdown and I want to make this my workflow.

During this stream we get RAIDED by TEEJ_DV! and chat about tmux a bit before calling the changes to markata-tui good and signing off.
