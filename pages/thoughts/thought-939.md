Learned about this one from the @stipete [interview](https://youtu.be/Wm7tsiJ1nIo?si=_qvZaR5SPWozBjrY) @scotthanselman did on YouTube.  This is proof that the internet is alive.  It's such web 1.0 nostalgia to see that people can just build things!  Did you know that you can literally just build things and make them exist?  You don't need users, You don't need a big platform, you can just make something into existance.  It seems like something we have forgotten through web 2.0 where everything as become 4 major apps all linking to each other and trying to hoard all of the attention. Scroll through tehre are some really cool apps, probably nothing that has the polish you want, or is going to change your world.  What these apps have more than anything you've probably used in the recent years, is inspiration.  Its xyz, but the way I wanted, or with my little twist.  And no one else has to like it but me because I'm the user.
