THIS, THIS is how most people are feeling about AI right now.  Theres lots of "oh ai bad", "but ai help", "but ai company sleezy".  Cassidy did a fantastic job summarizing how most of us are feeling.  Ending with well at the end of the day, I can't do anything about the bad, the best thing I can do is learn how to embrace the good cause it aint going away any time soon.
