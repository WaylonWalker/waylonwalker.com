#### Time

I am not sure that time heals all wounds, but some wounds just take time.  Yesterday during therapy Rhiannon finally had a chance to talk about some very tough topics.  It was very tough to talk about at the time, and I did have a bit of a rough afternoon following the appointment.  I am not sure why, but I just needed some space and time.  Today I feel quite a bit better and am ready to start my day on a good note!  I am not sure how long it will take for these wounds to heal but time will help.

I am very grateful that Rhiannon was able to give me some space and time yesterday after our appointment.  I know that it is very difficult for her to see me down.  I am also very grateful that she setup therapy for us and has given us this outlet to discuss topics like this.  I am grateful that we were able to bring it up and talk about it with a neutral party.
