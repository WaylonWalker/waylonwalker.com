> Just discovered this really cool launcher from the DHH distro omakub.  [github.com/omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub){.hoverlink}.

Ulauncher comes out of the box looking good, supports extensions, and shortcuts like I have a lot of mac launchers have.  I installed it plus a theme and in no time It was looking good and launching applications.

In the past I have leaned in on rofi for task launching, it is good.  I just felt it was harder to configure to get right or look good.
