When we got our ender 3 my son was 11. We assembled the day it came in and
started the test print that came on the card. We watched as it painstakingly
took hours to print the small sample.  Already past his bed time, he was there
to pull it off the bed immediately.

He woke me up at 5 am to tell me he found an stl online, installed the slicer software, set it up for our printer, sliced his model, got the gcode on the sd card, to the printer and had it running already while I was sleeping.

We had never once talked about 3d printing to this level, this was all him doing the research on his own.  Having that interest that turns into an itch that you can't shake, you must read, learn, and try until you figure it out.
