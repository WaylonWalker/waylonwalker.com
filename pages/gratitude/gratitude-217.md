I'm not missing a day here, I'm on a streak!  We are getting hit with heavy
wildfire smoke here, we are right in the middle of the jetstream. Some days its
even hitting us with visibility warnings.  I am so grateful that we have clean
air inside of our houses and vehicles.  I am grateful that we are not getting
hit with wildfires or any other natural disasters, and all we are hit with is
being constrained inside a bit more with a family of sensitive lungs.
