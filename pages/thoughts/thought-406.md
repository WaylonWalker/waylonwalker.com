Interesting take on refactoring the whole codebase from your editor.  In this thread the-mikedavis suggests multicursor as a replacement for substitute, and later in the thread takes the side that larger workspace wide edits are outside the scope of helix and he would reach for a refactoring tool like [fastmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod?tab=readme-ov-file) to do the job.
