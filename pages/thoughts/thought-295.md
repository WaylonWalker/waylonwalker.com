Sometimes I struggle to get my os to report dark mode to chrome, luckily there is a way to force chrome to always use dark mode.

I've never really gotten into dark reader and extensions like this. For some reason they all make websites look really weird to me and I don't really care for it.  What I want is websites designed to be in dark/light to always go dark, if the designer didn't design dark just let it be light.
