> Oh, this kills me to hear it.  RSS is the OG way to subscribe and share content out to others.  It gives you control of what you subscribe to and reminds you when new content lands on your favorite sites.  It is a huge component of web 1.0 and I feel is the most decentralized social media can ever hope to be.
