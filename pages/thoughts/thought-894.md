> Such a good breakdown of the leerob article, that is hitting everywhere right now.  Feels like sanity was just a bit late to getting things right and it would have just worked for them how leerob was trying to use it, but MCP sucked so he jumped.

Reading their loose descriptions of a CMS, its an interesting realization to realize I'm rolling my own cms.  I kinda feel like theres a few inspiration features to take from here, but I have no regrets.  As a developer I like being able to build my own tools, I like being able to search and edit from nvim, and not have to write GROQ queries, and transforms.  There were some really good points here that as I get more and more content on my personal site, I do kinda feel it.  I'm surprised there is not more tooling that does some of these things for piles of markdown.

pinning this to re-read later, feels like a lot of good tidbits here.
