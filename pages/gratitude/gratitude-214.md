Today was better.  I am getting a more comfortable desk setup and that is
making a huge difference.  I got a full back chair, and Rhiannon made me a
monitor stand so that my monitor is at eye level.  On the desk my stock monitor
stand was setting the top of the monitor about 3 inches below my eyes.  Being
hunched over in a small chair all day for day one was not comfortable.  I am so
grateful for the stand that Rhiannon made for me, it is beautiful, not quite
finished, but beautiful.  Its made from flooring that we put down on our house,
a chunk of plywood I used as a table saw, turned Wyatts desk in the old house,
now turned my monitor stand.  The trim is made of Wyatt's zoo that he had in
his room about 10 years ago.  Its a beautiful amalgamation of all things from
our family.

I got to have lunch with Ayla at the park, and go on a special run with her to
get a smoothie "to give her energy" to finish out the last 2 hours of
rehearsal.  She is at Annie rehearsal for 5 hours with a 1 hour lunch break in
the middle.  That kid is putting in some hard work, I am so proud of her.

I ended the day doing some modeling, inspired by this guy that shows up in our
short feeds that is making modular storage containers to mount on a wall we are
starting work on some modular storage boxes, we started prototyping the handle.
