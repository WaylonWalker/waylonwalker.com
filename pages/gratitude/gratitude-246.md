As the sweat drips off my brow we wrap up another fantastic day of vacation on
the beach.  The afternoon humidity really hits this place hard and we've had a
full day out in the sun so I'm leaving this one a bit shorter.

We started off with an early morning wake up by the kids.  

> "Can we go to the warehouse?"

The warehouse is what they call the giant rec room of this old wedding venue, I
find the name cute.  So I stumbled down to the kitchen area pleases to find a
tea kettle and a french press that made damn good work of the fresh beans I
brought from home.  I sat in the office for a few minutes to enjoy.  "the
office" is what we call this cool crows nest kind of place that overlooks "the
warehouse" and has 270degree wrap around bay windows.

About the time I wrapped up my coffee Rhiannon was making her way up, and we
got ready to go to the beach.  From there on out it was a great day out on the
lake, out to Culvers to eat, and to Piggly Wiggly to pick up our supper chicken
taco salad that we made at the house without producing any extra heat.

I'm about to soak through my fresh shirt already sitting in "The Office", so
I'm calling it good.  I am so grateful to be able to provide this trip for my
family and everyone to have the strength and energy to enjoy it.
