I am back!  I'm not sure what flipped, but yesterday afternoon the crash did not hit, and I was actually doing really well, woke up this morning doing just as well and ready to go. I feel like I've woken from a long daze unable to think clear, unable to talk without coughing.  I am really grateful that it feels like this thing is finally moving on and I can move on from it soon.
