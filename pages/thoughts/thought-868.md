Absolutely banger of a video, what a wild idea to send gippity a bit off course and just see how far off the rails it will go.  Dude did a banger of an edit on it.  I'll admit that I listened to the whole thing, but did not watch much, saving here as I might go back when I have time to really watch it.  It was really weird how easy it was for chat to say something that could be true, but nearly no chance of it actually happening over and over and just keep it going down this dark spiral of conspiracies.  It was ready to electrocute him and separate him from anyone who had a chance of being a non believer.  At any moment was ready to say that those closest to him might be his problem.  gipity is not your friend, or your therapist.
