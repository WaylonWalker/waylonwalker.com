#### Initial post

Thank You for getting up with me this morning.  I really appreciate all of the extra help.  It means a lot to have my life partner there with me in the morning helping with the kids.


#### Thank You

Those two words are very powerful.  This morning when I was helping Rhiannon cut her hair she looked at me and told me thank you very sincerely.  It cut really deep inside, and made me feel really good.  I dont think I expressed my gratitude for it very well as I had not yet had my coffee, and my response time was a bit lacking.  This is something that I would like to work on with my kids.  We really focus on our please's but, sometimes Thank Yous are forgotten, and we are just happy that they are happy.

Overall I am most grateful today for the good morning that I have had with my beautiful wife Rhiannon and our two kids, Ayla and Wyatt.
