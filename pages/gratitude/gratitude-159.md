Laundry room is working!  It appears that for years the dryer vent has been
just kinda set on top of the hole in the floor, not attached at all..... This
had blown dryer lint over everything in the laundry room, and I am curious if
it contributed tot he excessive duest on everyting in the whole house.  I got
it all cleaned out and hooked up to the best of my ability.  The connections
have a solid couple inches overlap and taped tight.

The one issue that we ran into was. I fully setup the washer, then pulled it
back out, and forgot to put the drain back on before running a load and
draining in onto the floor.
