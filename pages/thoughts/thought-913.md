> This post was filled with real life, snark, entertainment, feelings.  I get a lot of these emails that claim they can change my SEO game if I give them 500, for a site making 0, Link partnerships from small startups.  A lot of these are so automated that if I do respond I dont even get a response.  I've responded to many simply asking what is this about, I get 10 others just like you a week.  Can you tell me what exactly you want and what each of us benefit from it, how did you find me.  All normal questions, they almost always result in crickets, no response, maybe its time to implement a Billie for more snark.
