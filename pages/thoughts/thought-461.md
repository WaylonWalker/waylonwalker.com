> This is a pretty great episode talking shop with typecraft.  They talk setups, cameras, content creation. I found them talking about their linux setups particularly interesting.  Dax talked about his flow from building his own machines to using reliablesite.com.

## tmux default leader

Dax hates on c-a, both typecraft and dax use c-s, which normally freezes a terminal, we can all agree that is useless.  I use the default c-b, it seems fine for me.


## type crafts setup

* Ubuntu 
* Ghosty
* Tmux
* Nvim
* Ruby

## Selling coffee without a web front end

Dax talks about terminal.shop and how they originally planned to have a web front end, but after they had so much success they stuck with it.  now they are leaning harder into it and are building out integrations with a bunch of languages and an api, but no front end.
