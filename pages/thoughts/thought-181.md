> DataDog ddqa is building out a textual app and deploying it with pyapp.  They have CI setup to fully build and cross compile their textual tui into github releases that you can just download from their releases page.  This is something I am looking at for markata.  This would be pretty sweet to be able to make it just work on places like windows.  It would also be interesting to try to build a full desktop app with pyapp.
