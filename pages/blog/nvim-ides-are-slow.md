## Slides ðŸ‘‡

## welcome

[//]: <> (Rather than saying vim is fast lets fix some things live.  While we are trying)
[//]: <> (to present on how fast vim is, popups will iterrupt with critical production)
[//]: <> (failures that need fixed straight away.)

[//]: <> (## topics)
[//]: <> (* lsp)
[//]: <> (* make vim yours)
[//]: <> (* I use tmux)
[//]: <> (* quickfix)

## Other possible titles

* Using Vim as a Team Lead
* I ðŸ’œ Tmux
* Why I stopped using @code
* Get there fast
* How I vim

## It's ok

Use a graphical IDE if it works for you.

## Trick it out

vim is so well integrated into the terminal, take advantage

## It wasn't working for me anymore

[//]: <> (seriously,)

## dozens of instances

As a team lead I bounce betweeen a dozen projects a per day

[//]: <> (Trying to run more than one instance of an ide is hard, especially when)
[//]: <> (projects are so similar and all start looking the same.)

## Move With Intent

Running vim inside tmux lets me move swiftly between the exact project I need.

[//]: <> (__)

## Hub and Spoke

* direct link to specific projects
* fuzzy into all projects
* fuzzy into open projects

[[ tmux-nav-2021 ]]#hub-and-spoke

[//]: <> (I'm sure there are other ways do do this, I bet you can get a vim plugin to do this)

## Other Things That Make this Possible

* tmux
* direnv

> vim adjacent things

[//]: <> (## Check messages)

[//]: <> (a short interruption where I am called back to work where I show flying swiftly)
[//]: <> (between projects with the perfect intent.)

## yes, vim is ugly, make it yours

@rook

``` vim
command! Q :q
```

@_waylonwalker

``` vim
nnoremap <leader>6 <c-^>

## lsp

``` vim
lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()
```

## treesitter

``` vim
Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects'
```

## telescope

fuzzy matching like a boss

fzf is ok too

[//]: <> (* Use the lsp go to definition.)
[//]: <> (* Open data in visidata)
[//]: <> (* use jumplist to get back)
[//]: <> (* make the fix)
[//]: <> (* use fugitive to commit)
