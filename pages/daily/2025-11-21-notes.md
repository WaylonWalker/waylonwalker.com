Learned about nginx_auth today.  Feels good to unlock a new skill that I did not quite understand before.  I don't think I grasped that there is a backend server in this flow to handle every request.  I could not fathom how this was secure with nginx alone.

I'm excited to give this a try in my homelab with k3s ingress next.
