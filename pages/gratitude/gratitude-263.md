Today was a chill day back in the office, heads down focused on my work.  I'm
grateful for these days, days filled with meeting get difficult.  I had a spark
of inspiration and just followed it for the day making progress on some stuff
on my roadmap that I wasn't really planning on getting to for a long time, but
it all grouped together in a way that depended on each other and I made some
big strides.

Rhiannon brought me lunch and I enjoy those so much with her, so glad that she
makes the trek when she can so that we can enjoy that time together.
