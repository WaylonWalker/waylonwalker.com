Went to the doc yesterday and got started on some good meds for the Bronchus.  Energey is starting to return and beast cleaned the main floor today.  Everything vacuumed up .  Still a lot of cleaning to do from being sick for so long, but its good progress.  My switches came in today, and they feel so good, I no longer have a hodge podge of switches, and these really do feel like my favorite that I've ran.  They are really good.  Loving this hotswap, I want to get some clickys from this line to run occassionally, idk what for other than why not.
