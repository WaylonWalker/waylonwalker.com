I'll triple down on the link-blog chain here, see this one going around all over this week and finally had time to read through when it hit my rss reader via Chris.

>  It should come as no surprise that nearly every vibe-coded app on the Internet struggles with security issues; look no further than the vibe-coded recipe app that leaks its OpenAI keys. Every time one generates code by prompt, they create a new stillborn program; vibe coding is the art of stitching together their corpses into Frankenstein’s monster.

Damn, that is a strong statement, stitching together the corpses, strong statement here.  The OpenAI key thing feels kind of obvious to me, every set of docs, blogs and examples on the internet need to be runnable for people to learn and try out new tech easy, putting secrets in the wrong place is easy, putting them somewhere that you can decode them without sharing them is hard team specific, app specific, and so nuanced to your architecture that its rarely included in public examples.  I imagine there are a lot of good code example out there that follow good practice, but it feels like that might have missed the training data here.

 It alrso reminds me of [thought-625-the-rule](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/625), where prime talks about small apps being happy and easy and at some point every change is hard, and likely  impossible to vibe code.

> The whole point of making creative work is to share one’s own experience - if there’s no experience to share, why bother? If it’s not worth writing, it’s not worth reading.

llms are not capable of being creative, they are word calculators, statistical models that predict the next likely word based on their experience, they are not capable of new discoveries.
