So proud of Wyatt today.  Tomorrow is the last day of school for the year, this
is his first full year back in public school since 2020.  Today was graduation
day from elementary school to middle school.  He has improved so much in his
skills at school, both academically and socially.  Today he cheered on his peers with full
confidence and enthusiasm as they won various awards.  He is filled with the
biggest heart and is a great friend to those who choose to understand and treat
him well.
