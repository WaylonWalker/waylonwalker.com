Opencode is changing on the daily right now, today I noticed the word `low` pop
up in Orange text in my opencode window.  Looking into this they are exposing
[variants](https://opencode.ai/docs/models/#variants) to the user.  This allows
you to change between fast or slow and thinking, the later taking more time to
prepare before doing an action.

It looks like this toggle may have been here for awhile and I'm just now
discovering it. Potentially because its a new feature of the free Zen provider.

> Variants
Many models support multiple variants with different configurations. OpenCode ships with built-in default variants for popular providers.
