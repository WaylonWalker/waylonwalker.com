> Absolutely love this selfhosted arc of pewdiepie that is going on right now.  It's crazy to witness now fast he is picking up linux / self hosting, and sounds like soon will be programming.  In this one he built a $20k AI beast that crushes gippity with power, speed, proximity, and security.  No one to take your data, no latency to the data center, no one else bogging down your prompts, just raw speed.  It looks absolutely wild.  He implemented RAG and gave it a bunch of data about himself and its able to spit out his wife's name and phone number in under a second.  It writes code at blazing pace.  This may be the future that we get over the next few years as things shift towards AI there will be more affordable options, and a larger second hand market for building out these highly capable machines.
