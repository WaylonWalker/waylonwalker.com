Never did I think I would see the day that theprimeagen decided to run [archlinux](https://archlinux.org/).  Furthermore him to start ricing it, EVEN furthermore, [Pewdiepie runs arch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0) now, and thinks you should too?? and is promoting it on one of the [largest YouTube channels ever](https://socialblade.com/youtube/lists/top/100/subscribers/all/global)??  Even DHH is getting in the mix with [omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) Such a cool transistion to see everyone find their way to linux and diving deep into the freedom and customization.
