I first met Adam in college, he seemed like quite a character on the outside, but was always quite smart and often leaned towards realistic solutions to problems rather than over complicating things.  He was part of the SAE Formula car, well known for taking a simple problem and trying to turn it into a real formula one carbon fiber solution.  I remember a period where he was a fan of old world blacksmithing as they would say at the time.  He even got a few very simple and light parts on the car that were easy to make unlike the carbon fiber alternatives.  By the time I was there he was more of a leader and did not do a lot of design on any whole system, but would take out class projects for a component or help with some hard problems.  This company feels like it is a great extension of who he was a that time, with about 15 years of professional experience tacked on.
