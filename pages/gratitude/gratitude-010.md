#### Strong Relationships

A few months ago my wife and I decided to start going to family therapy, to talk about some things that we could see were only going to get worse without giving them some attention.  This is the best decision we have made in our marriage.  We have really learned to relate to the other person, and put ourself in their shoes.  We are learning about how our actions effect the other.

Without taking steps in the right direction our marriage was heading downhill.  Medical needs were taking precidence, and we were both fighing through a dark hole of depression.  After the first session we saw great improvement.  I am grateful that we took the steps to work on our marriage in such a dark time for us on every other aspect of life.  I am grateful that we got a great therapist on first try.  I feel like you rarely get a medical professional that works for you on the first try.  I am grateful that we are both devoted to making it work, and have made great strides in our relationship.  Most of all I am grateful to see how taking the right steps to strengthen our marriage has improved other parts of our life, and made it easier to handle events as they come up.
