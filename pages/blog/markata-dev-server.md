**Draft Post**

I've really been digging [@willmcgugan's](https://twitter.com/willmcgugan)
[rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) library for creating TUI like
interfaces in python. I've only recently started to take full advantage of it.

## Dev Server

I am working on a project in which I want to have a dev
server running continuously in the background. I really
like dev servers theat automatically chooose an unused
port and list out the running pid so that I can kill it if
I need to.

- automatic port number
- auto-restart
- display _( port, pid, uptime )_

## finding the port

I am very novice at best when it comes to sockets, the following function came
from searching StackOverflow for how to tell if a port is in use. I
recursively check if a port is being used, if it is I increment by one until I
find an unused port to return.

```python
def find_port(port=8000):
    """Find a port not in ues starting at given port"""
    import socket

    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        if s.connect_ex(("localhost", port)) == 0:
            return find_port(port=port + 1)
        else:
            return port
```

## The Dev Server

I am going super basic here and just running `python -m http.server <port>`.
It works for what I need it for, it hosts my files for the browser to display,
and if I try a route without an index.html it gives me a decent file list.

```python
import subprocess

proc = subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "http.server", str(find_port)],)
```

> Optionally if you wanted a live-reload you could opt into `live-reload` from
> pypi.

The above snippet will start my dev server on the first open port starting at
`8000` and give me a `subprocess.Popen` object. From there I can see a bit of
information about the process.

```python
# returns the process id
proc.pid
# returns none if proc is still running
proc.poll()
```

## Rich

_a quick aside_

[rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) will assist in creating a beautiful
terminal interface with minimal effort. Here we are going to build a reuable
component to later use inside of a rich layout. When using `rich.print` or the
live display rich will execute a `__rich__` method on our objects.

```python
class Min:
    def __rich__(self) -> Panel:
        return Panel("hello world")


def make_min_layout():
    layout = Layout()
    layout.split(Layout(name="upper"), Layout(name="lower"))
    layout["upper"].update(Min())
    layout["lower"].update(Min())

    return layout
```

- `__repr__` - custom method
- `Panel` - box around a renderable
- `Layout` - split and nest renderables

There are many components to rich, but the basics I am using so far here are
making my own components with a `__repr__` method, `Panel`, and `Layout`.
Panel is an object that will by default take up as much space as it can and
draw a rounded border around itself. Layout is an object that accepts other
rich renderables, can be split and nested.

## Final Result

Here is a image of the final result running. Here I have
the server running on the top split and kill the running
server several times. You will see a quick flash of <span
style='color: red'>server died</span> followed by the
sever back up and running on a new pid.

```python

class Server:
    def __init__(self, auto_restart=True):

        self.port = find_port()
        self.start_server()
        self.auto_restart = auto_restart

    def start_server(self):
        import subprocess

        self.proc = subprocess.Popen(
            ["python", "-m", "http.server", str(self.port)],
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        )

    def __rich__(self) -> Panel:
        if not self.proc.poll():
            return Panel(
                f"[green]serving on port: [gold1]{self.port} [green]using pid: [gold1]{self.proc.pid}[/]"
            )
        else:
            if self.auto_restart:
                self.start_server()

            return Panel(f"[red]server died")
```

## Future State

Future state this is going to be integrated into the main layout for my
personal website SSG markata.
