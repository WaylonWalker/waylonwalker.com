Ai is a tool I use a lot for code generation, research, image generation, and
debugging.  The words I publish on this site are my own unless explicitly
stated from the top.  There's only one or two posts in this category.

## Words are mine

The core of what this blog is, is my thoughts ideas, sharing experiences.  The
words are the important part.  They are not perfect, I often do not spell or
grammer check, and what is here is from a flow state of writing and very often
not refactored.

## code gen

Up till around 2023 all of the code to create the site was hand written by me.
I have my own site generator that I maintain [[ markata ]].

From 2023 through 2025 snippets of code, sometimes entire plugins or modules
were created in chat apps like chatgpt.  There was no agentic coding, windsurf,
cursor, claude code, opencode, none of it.  It was all integrated into the site
by hand.

Starting around Dec 2025 I was finding freely available agents through tools
like opencode to be more and more useful, making less mistakes, doing better at
getting context and making changes.  The flow is relying on heavy planning and
issue reporting.

## image gen

I really got into stable diffusion as it came out.  I thought it was
fascinating to generate different kinds of images of things that I would
otherwise have no ability to create, for a long time I was generating images
for every post.  I've moved on from doing it for every post, but still do it
occasionally.
