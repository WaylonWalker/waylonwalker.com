This is a wild key cap that uses a lever to convert horizontal key presses to vertically press the switch down.  The leveret v2 uses two of these on thumbs, one to press outward, and what appears to be one straight forward which feels like it would have to be a wrist motion, but who am I to judge without having it in person.
