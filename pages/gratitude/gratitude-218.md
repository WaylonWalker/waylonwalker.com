Today was set build day for Annie Jr, and wow this old theater was amazing to
be in, there was so much history and character wrapped up in that building.
The retired gentleman that was helping us build knew so much about set build it
was really amazing to take in.  He was celebrating his birthday that day and
was still there with us.  He had so much patience teaching others who were less
handy and even children how to cut, drill, screw and build the whole set.  This
man Howie was an amazing man and it was an honor to meet him today.
