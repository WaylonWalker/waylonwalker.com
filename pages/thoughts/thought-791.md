> there is literally no universe that this is true
10k lines and its not bug filled crap?  ok Lex Luthor, its time to step away from the keys

Is this 10k real production code?  Dry in the sense that it hasn't re-implemented the same s3 api dozens of time?   What language are we talking something dense like python? something very verbose like html? Maybe a language where you implement everything from scratch like lua.  This matters a lot.  Playing with little POC applications that dont mean anything I can quickly come up with 500-1k likes of code that I may never look at again.  I'm sure I can come up wtih 10k decent lines of code a day.  

But for the same application without duplicating everything over and over?  For something that moves the needle and really matters?? **every single day**?? Consistently +10k, not 10k changes, not 10k deletes of yesterdays code. nah thats wack.
