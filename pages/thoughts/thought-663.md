I am going to start trying to employ this rhythm to my writing.  I'm not very sure how I feel about it, there is something almost too assertive about it.  It's giving me a (i'm great and you should too) kind of vibe.   I want to become more assertive in my writing.

I'm giving this a shot and see what I learn, you might notice in my tils.
