> Damn this one is getting some reach, I've seen it from [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/7/adam-wathan/#atom-everything) and [Justin Searls](https://justin.searls.co/takes/2026-01-07-14h15m44s/) and [t3.gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luhgjBrRulk).  I feel for Adam, He has built a fantastic product that the world is running with, something we all needed.  Something that everyone laughs at turns their nose up "ppft I don't need that" the first time they see it, but once they try people get it, and a lot of them like it and keep it.  But its something that no one really wants to pay for, no matter how big of products get built on it.  As we see more and more features coming to css, its not stopping, the work will always be there.  I really hope to see something happen to tailwind to keep it afloat. massive growth and revenue down 80% does not help.
