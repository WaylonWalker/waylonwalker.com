> I'm trying to level up my sre game.  I'm trying to set up grafana dashboards for everything and it is such a wide surface area.  It's never just one thing you have to have 3 or more things hooked together in order for the data to flow.

I'm really getting not invented here vibes, and thoughts that I can just build this myself.  Not grafana and it's scalability necessarily, but small components of observability.
