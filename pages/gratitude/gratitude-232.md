Tonight Wyatt and I had a Dude's night in as Ayla wen to a cast party.  We had
a blast, between trampolining and Cat Quest III it was so much fun.  He is
really getting more interested in self hosting and linux again, he really wants
something more customizable than bazzite.  More power to him, I love it, we
just gotta find a way for him to play before he makes it his main thing.  He
instantly knew the way was a virtual machine, but bazzite was holding us back a
bit.  I'm not sure how much he wants to do self hosting vs sees me doing it and
wants to mirror me.  His first request was backing up his files, very legit
request, in the past its been combinations of things that don't make a lot of
sense, but I get this.

* Cat Quest III
* Trampoline
* Chicken Sandwiches togehter
* Cat Quest III
* Homelabbing, talking about arch
