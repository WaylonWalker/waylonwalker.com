I ran this post on dev.to and got a great response of great examples, [check it out](https://dev.to/waylonwalker/what-s-on-your-github-profile-40p3).

The GitHub profile feature just went live for a subset of users.  Simply creating a repo named after your username, and clicking share to Profile on the sidebar will create a custom profile that shows up just above your pinned projects.

I am still trying to figure out what to put on mine, but this is what I have so far.  I feel like mine is a bit big at the moment, I don't like that my pinned repos end up blow the fold.

## updated

I tightened mine up and took inspiration from a few others.
