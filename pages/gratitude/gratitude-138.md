title: Gratitude 138

Boxes came today!  Getting ready to really dig into the next phase of
this move.  It's a combination of exciting and overwhelming.  I am so
incredibly grateful that this is the last time that we have to do this
semi-unwillingly for a long time!  There is no more landlord, no more
owner to deal with.  The next place is all for us to decide what to do
with.  We get to pick the colors, we get to pick what new appliances to
put in.  Most importantly we get to choose when we want to move.  We
will be in a very stable place where we are in much more control.

Dobby is still cute as can be and spent quite a bit of the morning time
with me.  In fact he completely fell asleep on my desk for one meeting I
was in.  He is so far doing fantastic with all things puppy, fingers
crossed that we can continue to guide him to good and not need to battle
him every step of the way.  We really could not ask for a better puppy
for us!
