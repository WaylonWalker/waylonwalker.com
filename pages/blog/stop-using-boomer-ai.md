I was listening to these guys talk about migrating off of boomer ai the other
day.  Introducing the term boomer ai to describe using chat, copy, paste
instead of agents.  Something magical happened to the tooling and models around
december, they got really good.  The chatgpt $20 plan hooked into opencode is
good, the Free models in Opencode Zen (Big Pickle and Kimi K2.5 Free) are
really good.  Neither of these quite match up to the speed and quality of the
larger plans, but they are good.  good enough to throw away your boomer ai
techniques and start using agents.  Agents are the future, and they are here
now.  If you are still using chat, copy, paste, you are doing it wrong.  Stop
using boomer ai and start using agents.  You will be amazed at how much better
your results will be.
