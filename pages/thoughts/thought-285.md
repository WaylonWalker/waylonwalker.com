This is one of my favorite changelog episodes of all time.  I had no idea all the work that has gone into the right to repair and ifixit.  They talk a lot about apple and its trend to be less repairable from unservicable air pods to serialized components within iphone.  

A lot of legal talk that was far more interesting that I thought it would be.  Recently winning the right to repair case against John Deere, and creating repairability scores for devices to be placed in stores like energy guide is.
