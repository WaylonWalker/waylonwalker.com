What a wild ride this weekend was, a lot that I can't really talk about here went on, but damn it all hit in unexpected ways.  It's funny how you think about things, and maybe talk to someone close to you about how something will eventually present itself and what you might do.  Then when it finally hits it's totally unexpected and becomes the out of left field version that you didn't even have on your bingo card, but at the same time it all makes sense in retrospective.  That was my weekend.  I'm very grateful for my wife in her infinite wisdom in the way she is able to manage complex emotions especially with others, I tend to sit and think quietly, but no coherent phrases are really able to form in ways that hers does.  It's likely that she's put far more thought, not just into the topic itself, but all the permutations of this and EVERY possible other topic around this topic.  She has formed thoughts ready to go, whereas I struggle to come up with any logical reasoning.  I am so grateful to have such a great partner who is able to fill my personal gaps so well.
