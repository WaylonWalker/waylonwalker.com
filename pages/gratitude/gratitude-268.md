I was [[ shots/doing-some-keeb-modeling-and-thought-this-was-cool ]].  It's the
inside of a keyboard before the key tools are used to cut away the board
material revealing hotswaps, print in place support and keywells.  I've gotten
back in to refining the model for my next keyboard, all of the details take a
long time and can get tedius, but its actually really realaxing when you are
working in a model that you laid out really nice and is a pleasure to work
with.  This is about the 3rd iteration or more of this model so it's actually
setup really well, theres currently 281 features in this model, on top of the
hundreds more in the derived geometry.  It gets very complicated, less than I
first thought, but more that I thought it would be when I really got into it.

Today I am very grateful for my family, and to be able to enjoy time with them
every day.  I took Ayla to acting class today where she started to learn
improv, and tell me about it on the way home.  Wyatt and I are are back to
working on the crane, and getting very close to the end.  He is already
planning and excited to work on the forklift next.  Overall there is just so
much stress in the world right now, the best I can do is be grateful that I
still have those around me at the end of the day.
