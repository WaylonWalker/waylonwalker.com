> What a great first guest for FAFO.  Kelsey is always such a great listen.  He talks about killedbygoogle and how engineers get no incentive to work on old projects, google had no incentive, and you got the thing for FREE in the first place.  He talks about end of career and having love you money, having so much in the bank you can say no.  If you are presented with a project that does not align with your values you can say no.M

Justin even mentions how Google has more killedbygoogle projects than Amazon has total projects.


> If we knew how hard it would be, we would never build it.
