Damn 2024 is such a shit show, now Devin seems to be out as a complete scam.  It's really teaching us to have skepticism for what you find on the internet.  Turns out that when broken down frame by frame much of the description in the video was a straight up lie.  Personally it seemed quite plausible that it was percentage points better than the competition, but I was not holding my breath for it to be a hands off engineer.
