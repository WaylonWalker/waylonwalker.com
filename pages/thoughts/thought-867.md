> Lean on your skills and your goals. If your goals are to have fun, use whatever you want. If you are looking for a job, Lean on tech that bridges the gap between your resume and the job you want. If you want to build a good product use the tech you are best at. No one in their right mind would throw away 20 years of tech progression because Zuck built facebook ftping php to a server.

The sentiment in this post is fine at best the picture feels triggering and oversimplies  way too much.  If you like kubernetes [[ just-fucking-use-kubernetes ]].

This topic deserves a full on post, maybe later.
