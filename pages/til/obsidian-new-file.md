Wikilinks are a core concept within obsidian to link to documents by [[slug]] wrapped in double square brackets.  These are commonly used within wiki site generators.

``` markdown
[[slug]]
```

Obsidian gives you a keybinding `alt+enter` to go to that file, but if it does not exist it will create the file for you in the root of the project.  It's a nice way to quickly make new documents.
