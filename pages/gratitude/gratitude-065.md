#### We played hard

Today was filled with Dr. appointments... and Wyatt was still out of school.  Days like this can terrify my sometimes, but Wyatt was completely on board with it and we had a blast the entire day.  We played minecraft pocket edition in the wating room in apt 1, followed by some errands, a wonderful family lunch.  Then we played around a fountain at the last one, and it was a blast.  As he had surgery a week ago it has been awhile since we played this hard... and stayed completely positive the whole time.  We just went with the flow starting with some simple toys we had, to ninja moves, to an epic ninja Herobrine battle.  These are the moments that I yearn for as a parent.  Playing one on one, completely positive, in the flow, no fights, and having a blast.
