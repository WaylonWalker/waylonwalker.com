Nailed the netflix documentary style.  Videos like this make me so grateful that I have  a job in this rough market, if you've followed jepi's series you know he's been out of a job for months, and he is not alone in this.  This is the year of "laid of, i didn't get laid off, I left to focus on my startup", [[ thoughts-716 ]]
