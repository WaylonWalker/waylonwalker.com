> Focus on the joy, not the suck.  Nothing you do in life will be absolute pure joy with no downsides forever, life does not work that way, your brain does not look that way.  Look at anyone who ever got massive billion dollar payouts for something like minecraft and how much their life is not glorious when they have nothing to really look forward to.

Prime talks about it in almost a cliche way, every boring ass task is an opportunity to grow.  This is so real though, if you look at every task ask a shit you gotta do to check that jira ticket off and make bossy lady not scream at you its going to be a hell.  If you rather look at it as opportunities to implement new features in new ways or learn something to better yourself and watch yourself grow you are going to take a big dopamine hit.  I think prime talks about this in the sense of larger projects.  He as talked about his experience being much less of a daily standup, but more of a ok we got three months to figure this out lets go boys.  When you are stuck in that daily jira grind it's harder to see that larger picture of the learning and growing you are doing over the course of 3 or 6 months.

Timestamped to the part of the video that really dives into gratitude and finding the joy in the work that you have to do on purpose, but the whole vid is fire.
