I was curious how/if my custom keycap design was hitting my switches.  So I set
out to find out what the fitup inside of this assembly looks like, but not
theoretically, a fully sliced view into their fit up in the flesh.

## The set up

To setup for this cut, I flooded the edge of a 2x4 with hot glue, and inserted
the cap such that the step was tangent with the edge.  This way I could use the
edge as a guide to cut one side off and leave the stem in tact.  I took a
handsaw to it and filed it smooth.

Removal was applying some isopropyl alcohol and it popped right off.

## Results

Actually the results aren't that interesting.  I found that the pictures turned
out really good, but nothing was touching and it sits in the stem exactly as I
thought it did.  I had a thought, what if the cap is not allowing the switch to
reach it's full travel, and had no way to know, but now I know.
