Homelabbers have been some of the best co-workers I have ever had.  Typically have a get shit done, If there's a way I will find it kind of mentality.  If you are struggling to get a job in tech right now its tough.  Starting a homelab on a pc you pull out of the trash is a good way to get some experience that you can talk about in interview questions.

Linked video has some great points!
