title: Gratitude 101

---

Christmas has been a blast so far. Everyone has been just having so much fun,
with almost no arguing or complaining.  There is so much gratitude shown for
the things that we have recieved big or small, fun or utilitarian.  We are sad
that we cannot go see our extended family, but its been really nice to have
this focused time with just our close family bringing us together even
stronger.
