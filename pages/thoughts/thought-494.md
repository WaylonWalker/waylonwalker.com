> A nice list of slashpages you might want to consider including / aliasing / 301ing. These feel like nice things to setup and keep in the back pocket for obsidian style wiki link to easily.  I get kinda bad at wiki-linking as much as I would like to, mostly because it does require some amount of work to make the page, and keep it up to date over time, then remember that you even have it.

Some are serious, some very common, some quite useful.
