Trailmakers 2.0 Pioneers was released today as an update to trailmakers.  It's
a brand new campaign mode that requires you to mine resources to get materials
to craft your vehicles rather than salvage parts like you so in the Stranded
Campaign.  There also seems to be a more linear play through of the story with
the frogitts, unlike stranded where it let you do anything completely open
world, as long as you had the equipment to go there.

## Four Frogitts

Out of the gate Wyatt came in with four frogitts to rescue, I don't know how he
found them all, I've only been able to find the first one that the master gives
you to bring home as a tutorial.

## First Boss

After Wyatt left for bed I played a little more and beat the first of what felt
like a boss level enemy, he had much different attacks.  I did not think I
would make it as I got hit hard from his first explosion attack before I
realized what it did.

Here is where he was on the map.

## First Mega Drill

So this first mega drill was a mistake we walked right into.  Master Sapo says,
"Hey go investigate the Drill, but be careful, you are not powerful enough for
it."  Little did we know that getting too close will fully start the battle.

## Leapsville Froggit rescue

Back to leapsville we were presented with two froggit rescues.  We later found
out that the settlement missions will repeat forever and cycle through a few
missions.

After doing a few missions we completed leapsville.

## Finding Sulfur

Finding sulfur in Trailmakers was a little tricky, first trying to find where
it was, then realizing that it was hidden in this bulbous plant.

## Meadows Intercity Bus Service

## Mega Drill Mudflats

We came into this mega drill thinking we were prepared, but I was wrong.  I
equipped shotguns thinking it would be kinda like the last one, at the last
second Master Sapo tells you that you need an EMP, which we got equiped.  Once
we got in we realized that getting close to anything is really hard and all the
shotguns were useless, and to top it off all the Botnak attacks make it
impossible to reconfigure.

## Huge Trophy Truck

I like making Trophy Trucks with big suspension.  They seem like they glitch
out more than they help, but I think they are fun, here is a huge jump I landed
hard in mine.

## Emperical Extractions

When pulling the scientists out of the their reserch to bring them back I did
not have enough boost to lift them, we needed to take a pitstop to get them up
to the treetops.
