Today I set up hypridle on my hyprland desktop build.  It was not too bad, I'm
probably going to tweak it as it I go if it bothers me, for now I'm giving it a
shot.  My monitor is sometimes a PITA to get to wake up, that is my main
concern.

``` bash
paru -S hypridle
```

Here is the config I landed on.

``` conf
# dim screen
general {
    lock_cmd = pidof hyprlock || hyprlock       # avoid starting multiple hyprlock instances.
    before_sleep_cmd = loginctl lock-session    # lock before suspend.
    after_sleep_cmd = hyprctl dispatch dpms on && ddcutil setvcp 10 100  # to avoid having to press a key twice to turn on the display.
}

listener {
    timeout = 120                            # in seconds.
    on-timeout = ddcutil setvcp 10 5 # command to run when timeout has passed.
    on-resume = ddcutil setvcp 10 100  # command to run when activity is detected after timeout has fired.
}

# screen off
listener {
    timeout = 3600
    on-timeout = hyprctl dispatch dpms off
    on-resume = hyprctl dispatch dpms on
}

# warning screen is about to go off
listener {
    timeout = 315                            # in seconds.
    on-timeout = notify-send "You are idle!" # command to run when timeout has passed.
}

listener {
    timeout = 330                            # in seconds.
    on-timeout = loginctl lock-session
}

```

learned about `walker` launcher and `wev` wayland event debgugger.
