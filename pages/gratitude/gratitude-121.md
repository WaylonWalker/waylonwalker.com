I think we did it!! We put an offer in on a house, negotiated, and accepted a
counter offer.  This is all moving so fast, there is so much more to go, but I
really think we are going to have a place to live before we are sent out of
here! It is down to the wire, its so close, but there is a really good chance
everything is going to come together.  I seriously cannot believe this.  In no
way did we think we were ready less than a week ago, and as we started looking
into rentals all the same feelings come back.  The houses are kinda what we
want, but never quite the home we imagine, and there is not much we can do
about it.  And the fate of where we are next month is always in the fate of
someone elses hands.  Now it's still between us and the bank, but as long as we
hold up on our end there is not much that can actually happen, unlike renting.
