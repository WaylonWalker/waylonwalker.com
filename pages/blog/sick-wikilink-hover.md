Today I set up some sick wikilink hover effects using tailwind see [[
a-case-for-tailwindcss ]]. When you hover over them they show an image preview
of the link that you are going to.  I cant find where I have seen this but it
comes from some docs sites.

I'll finish this article later, just excited to see it up.
