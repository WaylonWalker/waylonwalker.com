> Very inspiring video Jason, these people faced adversity and crushed it.  The market is so hard right now, its not easy to get a job, move around, and recover from a layoff.  Everyone in this video just showed that you can make it in this industry right now, you just have to be willing to work harder than the rest.  The bar is raising, a lot of great people are already putting in hard work to make it.

Community is Key,  Theo mentioned that a lot of the companies he works with don't even post openings, they go to their community first and are often filling spots through lower risk community hires.
