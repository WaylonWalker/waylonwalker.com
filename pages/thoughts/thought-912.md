What a goat, speedrunning silksong at a competitive pace, live, with live audience, while co hosting, and raising $2M for Prevent Cancer Foundation.  CEEN moves in ways that do not compute with my brain, everything looks so simple, things that take me so long are done in a few swipes.  Watching this it really make silkspear look OP, this thing does so much damage if you never take damage and can use it continuously without needing silk for healing.
