Steve is such a great listen, the neurospicy 🌶️ rambles this episode goes on is so relatable.  I feel like I really missed out on some great takes on intellij vs neovim, but got some really great knowledge about vector db's, embedding, text compression, similarities to vector algegra like infinite craft. 


Just popped open infinitecraft and I've definitely played this with my kids before, super fun, just could not remember the name of this one.  I do remember an android one as well that is alchemist or something like that, which we have also played a lot.
