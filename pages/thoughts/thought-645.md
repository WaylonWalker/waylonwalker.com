> Markata got a shout out part way through the latest episode of LNL, I will go back, re-listen and take some of the feedback.  His thoughts on Markata were interesting. On one hand it really is a thing for me that works for me, and as a person with too many side projects I don't have the focus to really give it polish.  On the other hand it really confirms why listen to podcasts, news, finger on the pulse, opinions and how often these guys are wrong, they are not the expert they probably look at 6 things like this a week.  He said that it was some sort of javascript thing, that maybe he could fix or customize with javascript if he wanted, kinda shocking, I thought maybe I accidentally added node modules or something dumb, nope, I have a whopping 1.4% js.  So most of the comments were plain wrong.  I get it he probably peeked at it for 30s and realized it wasn't the thing for his problem.  At the same time I should probably do a better job at marketing what it really is, cleaning up the docs and demo.
