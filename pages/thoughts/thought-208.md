I've been using this for a few weeks now and it's fantastic.  It's reminds me of lazygit, it gives a nice quick interface into the things I need and it just works.  Yes I can git status to see what changed, then diff the files, then commit hunks, but lazygit can do that in just a few keystrokes.  lazydocker does this for docker. It gives me a nice view into whats running, what's eating up disk space, and the networks I have.  And if I see I have a bunch of exited containers, there is a bulk command righ there to clean them up.

> tldr `docker ps` on steroids
