Dang this is such a good message.  I can't exactly relate to being forced into the overworking situation that PirateSofware is talking about.  I can relate to being conditioned to feeling a certain way and changing that is very difficult.  I can also relate to not feeling like I am getting enough done in the day.  Sometimes a bit of separation is good.
