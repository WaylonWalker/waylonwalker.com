I would love to have a browser based video editor I could throw on a server and do quick edits from anywhere.  I tried to get this one to work and struggled to get front end to send api requets to backend.  I think the root of it was their redis wants to run on 80, this caused a permission error so I tried to run 8880:80, but redis was still unable to start due to a config permission error.
