#### Helping each other

It's been a bit of a rough go in our family.  Above the normal advanced someone or several of us have been sick nearly all winter.  Rhiannon has seen the worst of the struggle with a very long running congestion.  Through all of this we are here to support each other.  The mental toll of being sick and tending to others who are sick takes a lot out of each of us.  We are still able to work together, pick each other up and keep going. Some days are harder than others, some days we do not feel at our best be we still find the strength to help the others through.  Yesterday Rhiannon helped me through a very rough time.  I am so grateful for her abilitiy to dig into the menal stuff and help out.  This is something that I find very hard to do.  She is great at it.  She is rally able to help me and the kids when we are feeling overwhelmed.
