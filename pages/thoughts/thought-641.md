> This is great, beautifully captures a modern backend view of https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/.  I honestly resonate with almost all of this.  I have found myself in more trouble than help when trying to fully vibe out a project.  It never refactors, it leaves it shit everywhere, it mostly does what you say, until you get to something that seems easy, so you try to do it yourself, but you break its brittle piece of shit into pieces any time you try to touch it.  AI coding help is great, mcp seems like it really has some game changing abilities, but hands of vibe coded crap aint there yet for me.
