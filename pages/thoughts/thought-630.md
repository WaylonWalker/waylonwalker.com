> Dang Strong takes against markdown here with a strong push for bespoke content models/structures.  This idea is completely foreign and wild to me.  I get it that markdown has its issues with flavors, add ons and what not, but overall its mostly transportable, its a skill that works most content sites and writing tools.  I am so far on the other side that I seek out tools with markdown as an option and lean away from wsiwyg tools with specialized data formats on the backend.

I'll end with, I'm also a dev that creates very simplified content and maybe seeing the backend of a site with lots of custom fields would be very eye opening for me.
