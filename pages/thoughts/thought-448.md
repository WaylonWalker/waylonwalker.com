I love me some styled rss, it's how the OG internet was made to be.  You choose what you want to read and when.  There is no middleman aggregator inflating the reach of things they want you to see or suffocating things against them.  It's just you and your internet friends.


## [Cassidy's Styled rss](https://cassidoo.co/rss.xml)

Cassidy has a quite lovely and easy to read rss feed, with an open source style sheet, that is part of her open source blog template for astro [blahg](https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg), love that name by the way!

## [Dave Rupert's Feed](https://daverupert.com/atom.xml)

I first learned of styled rss feeds from shoptalkshow.com, specifically from [Dave Rupert](daverupert.com).

Dave uses a pretty bog standard styled rss feed with [pretty-feed-v3](https://github.com/genmon/aboutfeeds/blob/main/tools/pretty-feed-v3.xsl).  This repo is probably the best place to start if you are looking to style your rss feed.

## [My RSS Feed](https://waylonwalker.com/archive/rss.xml)

My feed comes from my static site generator [markata](markata.dev), a plugins all the way down static site generator written in python, made for customizing, lacking just about any and all docs so you are on your own.
