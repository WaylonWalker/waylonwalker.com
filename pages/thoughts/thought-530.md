nice overview of availability measurements and what they really mean.  The crazy world we live in today depends on so many things runnig, its also so hard to measure your uptime, The uptime metrics can mean a lot of different things.  The site is up and accepting traffic, but can users make changes or submit orders, there is a lot more to it than just up or down.  I really appreciate Brittany's story from Nike nested in there.
