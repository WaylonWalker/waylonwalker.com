ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Waylon Walker.  Husband, Father of two, and creator things on the
web, learning, and teaching others.  I play lots of Minecraft, make art, and
skate everyday with my kids.  I finish the day binging episodes of Big Bang
Theory with my wife.

I believe in a decentralized platform where everyone has their own space on
this internet to share their thoughts and ideas.  I created my blogging
platform from scratch to learn about building tools with pluggy and diskcache.
I was frustrated with long build times, black holes of node modules, bloated
pages, and a lack of built in SEO tools.  Instead I built my own under funded,
over dreamed, nearly undocumented framework to that I love and maintain.

I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in building data pipelines and web
platforms with python.
