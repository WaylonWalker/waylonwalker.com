> I've only recently learned what colophon means, and I really like to read through site that use it.  If you don't know its about how the site is built.  I've always liked peeking under the hood of things to understand how they work, it's what turned me towards an engineering degree.

I love how he mentions that he chose the name when he was 17 and he is stuck with it.  I particularly like the name, it has something special to it.  Hats off to you for doing something that has lasted so long for you.  I fully understand though, I have projects that I made a year ago that I think why did I name it that.  At the same time when I try to think of a name I end up with the I don't have anything good and I'd rather build the thing so fuck it, its going to be what it is.
