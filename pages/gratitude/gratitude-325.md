This is a wild time to be in work wise, the vibe is shifting dramatically, code, syntax, files, the art of typing shit into a computer has shifted so dramatically this year.  Things that would have taken a team of people months to do can be planned for in days and generated in minutes.  Sometimes much of the existing functionality exists somewhere else, specing out clones is nearly as easy as just asking ai to do it.  It's an absolute insane time to live. We went from nothing but our own brains and fingers clacking away to getting some actually useful chat apps, to now agents with the ability to do deep research, web request, it can run tools and commands on your system.  It no longer needs you to even gather facts and context.  You are here for guidance, specing out what the business needs, and assuring that what you asked for is built without bugs and regressions.  The later part being the really hard part to figure out how to do right now.
