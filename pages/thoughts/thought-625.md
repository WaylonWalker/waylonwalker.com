Under 2000 everything is happy, green field.  Any decision you have made is relatively easy to back out of (barring you making a library with downstream users), but as you go, regret kicks in.  Regret we didn't make that pydantic 2 upgrade earlier, as new features become more apealing.  Regret that we chose sqlite for simplicity, speed, agility, and now we might need robust and distributed.  Regret that you chose a front end framework, or to have a front end at all to a backend problem.  Regret that you put 6 layers of abstraction on your db early on and now that you understand the problem you want different abstractions, but all of your endpoints deeply depend on the current one.

Vibe coding will not save you, it will only make these wrong decisions for you without the context that you have.  You will hate it's decisions more because you had no input into some of them.
