Niche companies will rise from the ashes.  Companies that want to build good products for customers.  Companies that will get hundreds of users.  They will treat them right and make enough money to support themselves, maybe.

Alongside them we will self host.  We will run our own services out of our basement.  There will be downtime, but its ok.  We will enjoy ourselves. We will tell everyone how much better it is BTW

Next to that is a firehose of shit piling back into the circular snakes mouth as all of your data flows freely between any company that can get their hands on it.  These companies will spend and make money hand over fist. Most people will continue to use these services until enough is enough and unplug from everything.

In this world I don't see how we sustain the amount of engineers we have created.  Small companies run lean, small, and allow slow organic growth happen.

It will be interesting to see play out.
