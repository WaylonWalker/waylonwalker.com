> Kelsey says several times in this interview, you don't need kubernetes.  If you are running one node you don't need kubernetes.  My question though is, would you use kubernetes?  Ya I get it if you are a web developer, data scientist, backend dev, but if you are looking to bee a whole ass engineer, or infrastructure engineer, you know kubernetes, Should you use kubernetes on single node?
