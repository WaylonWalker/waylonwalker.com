Bluesky is almost excatly like twitter was when I joined years ago.  It's gone crazy lately bogged deep in politics, bots, and ads.  I've seen like two scroll pages of ads in a row, its nuts.  What I did not know before Joel pointed out here is that the feed I am looking at is my following feed, its only feed of people I follow in descending order.  On bluesky you get to pick your feed!!!  This feels like tweetdeck did back when we were able to run that.  You could tune in search terms and save them it was glorious.  Bluesky has some really interesting ones that you can use like popular with friends, only posts, my bangers, that have a pre defined algorithms.
