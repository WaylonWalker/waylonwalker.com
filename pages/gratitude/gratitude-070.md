#### Great Morning

Today is kicking off as a pretty amazing morning so far.  The whole family was in a really happy mood, even right after waking up.  I enjoyed the start of sunrise running around with Wyatt at the bus stop, and continuing now while writing my gratitude and daily planning.  Even though I was 10 minutes or so behind getting out the door this morning everything else has been going flawlessly, especially the most important things; family, mind, mood, and gratitude.
