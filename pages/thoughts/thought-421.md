Gridfinity generator uses open scad, so you can make rugged boxes, bins and base plates with form input.  not fully custom fit to things, but you can custom size square bins, hole cut out sides and all.  From what I can tell, no bento box either. so as long as what you are looking for is square this generator has you pretty well covered.  I'm definitely using this for simple bins and rugged boxes.
