Theo's response puts a lot of my feelings about unit testing into words. It's crazy how cargo culty it becomes that the echo chamber of twitter can bring in beliefs that we think we believe, but have not experienced enough or put enough thought in to form our own opinion.

This video made me think so much that it turned into it's own blog post
