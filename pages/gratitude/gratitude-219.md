Rhiannon and I have been super busy on set build and watching the progress of
the whole stage come together has been so gratifying.  I'm so glad that we have
this activity together that combines our love of music, theater, story telling,
and woodworking / construction.  The other people there have been so great its
kinda nice to start finding a community again.  For so many years since college
the focus has been on our kids, and they have not wanted to do a lot of these
kind of activities.  I am excited to see the set come together and see the show
this weekend.
