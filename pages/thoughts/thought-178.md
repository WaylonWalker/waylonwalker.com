> Write it down.

You had a small discovery that had a marginal impact on your day.

> Write it down.

A blog does not have to be a **Blog**, it can be small meaningful posts.  There are absolutely no rules.  If you think you are going to end up with too many posts, that is a solvable problem, make a search, curate your favorite posts, make multiple feeds.

At the end of the day.
