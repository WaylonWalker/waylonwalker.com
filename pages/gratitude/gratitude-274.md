What a roller coaster of a day, started off crushing some tasks getting some
really good progress in, getting a high level of polish on one of my main
projects and feeling great about it.  Then home hit and kids had a rough night.
woof its been a whirlwind of emotions for them.  We try our best to guide them
in the right direction, and it's so hard to not just say the same things you
remember your parents saying.  In between this I tried to migrate
fluffed-up.com to Rhiannon's code-server and just got taken out by file
permissions errors over and over.  I was able to mount the same files on both
ends, have a nice edit experience, but nginx was not able to access them.  I
really think it was a user permissions issue.  Came back after supper and
punted to just hosting out of the same file system her smb share is on, and boom
it just freaking work ended the day with another big win.
