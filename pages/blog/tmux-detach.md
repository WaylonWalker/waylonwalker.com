tmux detach is a handy tmux command that will quit your current session while
keeping it running. The full name of the comamnd is `detach-client`, `detach`
is a shorthand.

default keybinding

```bash
bind-key          d detach-client
```

I have mine bound to `mod+d` where mod is alt.

```bash
bind -n M-d detach-client
```
