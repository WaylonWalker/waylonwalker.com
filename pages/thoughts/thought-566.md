> Long live RSS!  Rss is not dead David, you are right there.  I really agree with David that learning a topic well enough to form thoughts and write about it really help learning.  You don't need to be an expert, but forming your own thoughts, putting ideas in words takes a lot more than surface level knowledge.  When you try to write or speak about something you quickly realize where your holes in understanding are.

> Blogging helps me learn. When I commit knowledge to writing it reinforces what I know and shines a spotlight on what I don’t. Most topics require additional research. Even then, I occasionally get things wrong, or miss different ways of thinking, and I welcome corrections. I’ll often update and enrich my posts based on feedback. Without my blog I’d miss other points of view.

> As they say, the best way to get an answer on the internet is not to pose a question, but to assert the wrong solution! Most feedback I get is constructive. Sometimes it’s blunt but I try not to read into unspoken sentiment. Some people are more direct. If the end result is positive learning, I can take a hit or two.
