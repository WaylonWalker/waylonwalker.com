> What a heart breaking video to listen to.  I'm trying to do a better job of being positive right now.  I'm trying to look at the world in what I have control over (not much more than my attitude about it).  AI is killing so much right now I'm trying to look at it as the good tools the engineers made it to be.  Ownership is dying around every goddamn corner.  Hats off to Edison, this guy gets it.  We need more companies like this taking a stand for the average person who wants to make it out there.
