Today is chemo day.  Yaya start off with the sad note here.  I am so grateful
to be here with my wife supporting her.  Some days we have to juggle kids and
work and everything in between during these appointments.  Today is all about
her, no worries about other things.  The appointment time slotted right in with
no issues.
