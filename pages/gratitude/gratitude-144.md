Today it warmed up quite a bit and the sun was in full force on the big
dump of snow that we got last week.  It made just the most epically
packable snow.  This is something that we dont often see in our area so
we took full advantage.  The front yard was fully shaded and was still
powder, but the back yard had this packing snow.  I wanted to build a
huge snowman in the back and Wyatt wanted to continue his fort in the
front.  We compromised and built a fort in the back.

It was super fun and soemthing I home we talk about for years to come.
It turned out as the most epic igloo that I have ever witnessed in
person.  It was surprisingly easy to build with the nearly slushy snow
that we had today. He was so excited to show Rhiannon that he did a
video call wtih with her right from the comfort of the igloo.
