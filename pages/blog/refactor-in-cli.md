As projects grow patterns that worked early on break and we need to change things to make the project easier to work with, and more welcoming to new developers.

## git

Before you start mucking up a project with wild commands at the terminal check that you have a super clean git status. We may make some mistakes and need a way to undo 100's files and git makes it really easy if you start with a clean history.

```bash
git status
```

If we are ready to begin work we should see a response like this.

``` bash
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

It would also be wise to do this inside of a branch.  The minute you try to do something wild in your working branch someone will walk by and ask you to do a five-minute task, but your deep in refactoring and haven't left yourself a clean way back.

``` bash
git branch my-big-refactor
```

## grepr

Time for the meat of this refactor replacing text across our project.  I often will pop this bash function into my terminal session and tweak it as needed. This function is called `grepr` for `grep` then `replace`.  It will recursively search for a given pattern inside your working directory, then use `sed` to replace that pattern with another.

``` bash
grepr() {grep -iRl "$1" | xargs sed -i "s/$1/$2/g"}
```

If your pattern contains `/` characters such as for URLs you can swap the `/`'s in the `sed` command for `|`'s.

``` bash
grepr() {grep -iRl "$1" | xargs sed -i "s|$1|$2|g"}
```

You can find this function and more of my bash notes.

[[ bash ]]

## Example

I recently flattened this blog so blogs are under the top-level rather than under `/blog` and I used this technique to swap internal links to the new format.

``` bash
grepr() {grep -iRl "$1" | xargs sed -i "s|$1|$2|g"}


grepr "https://waylonwalker.com/blog/" "https://waylonwalker.com/"
```

## git diff

After running the replace command the first thing I want to see is everything that changed.  Looking at git diff will highlight exactly what changed since our last commit.

``` bash
git diff
```

## Work in small steps

If you're happy with the results commit them now.  It's best to do these commands that have a large effect on the entire project in small steps.

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "moved routes from /blog to /"
```

Working in small steps gives us an easy way to undo steps that may have been a mistake before it's too late.

## git reset

_How I do Mass Undo_

**be careful** work from a branch, make sure you started clean

Let's say I wanted to change every occurrence of one variable name to another.
Lets try to replace replace `pandas.CSVDataSet` with `pandas.ParquetDataSet`.

``` bash
grepr() {grep -iRl "$1" | xargs sed -i "s|$1|$2|g"}


grepr "pandas.CSVDataSet" "pandas.ParquetDataSet"
```

Upon inspection of the `git diff` we notice that there was an unintentional change to the `docs/standard-storage.md` file. To revert the entire change we can run.

**note** These resets are irreversible.  Make sure that you started with a clean `git status` and you are confident that you didn't have any work on your machine, not in the remote repo.

_<small><mark>match the remote and wipe out any changes</mark></small>_

``` bash
git reset --hard origin/main
```

_<small><mark>match our last commit</mark></small>_

``` bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

## agr

I have an alternative version that I occasionally use as well that utilizes the silver searcher `ag`.  It does a great job at following your .gitignore rules with no fuss, and can filter down to file extensions simply with flags like `--md`

```bash
agr() {ag -l "$1" | xargs sed -i "s/$1/$2/g"}
```

## git clean

_how I remove untracked files_

Sometimes our refactoring requires moving files around. If we want to undo steps like this git will not clean up untracked files.

``` bash
mv conf/base/sales-catalog.yml conf/base/sales/catalg.yml
```

_<small><mark>clean up untracked files</mark></small>_

``` bash
git clean -f
```

_<small><mark>clean up untracked directories</mark></small>_

``` bash
git clean -d
```

_<small><mark>clean up ignored files</mark></small>_

``` bash
git clean -x
```

`-x` can be a bit dangerous, be careful with it.  You can lose significant time by wiping out a `node_modules`, `venv`, or credentials.

## git  checkout

_How I undo single files_

If our command was mostly successful, but just a few extra files were touched I will manually revert them with `git checkout <filename>`

``` bash
git checkout conf/base/supply-catalog.yml
```

## git checkout --

_How I undo an entire directory_

Sometimes we need to undo an entire directory.  This command will undo changes
to all of the tracked files in the repo.

``` bash
git checkout -- /src/pages/blog
```

## gitui

I really love using `gitui` as a handy terminal interface to browse logs, diffs, and commit a few files at a time.  It starts up crazy fast and is very intuitive to navigate through diffs of changes like this one file at a time if the `git diff` gets too overwhelming.
