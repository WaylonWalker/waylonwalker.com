Linus is [[ techbrophobic ]] like the rest of us.  This is such an unexpectedly mild take from him.  I expected some threat to the mother of the vibe coder, but he gave a pretty great middle of the road take.  The industry sucks, it smells off, we know a lot wrong with it, it feels like theres a lot more wrong than we know.  But the tools that its making are really good when used in the right ways.  They are not a replacement for anything, they are assistive.  They can lift someone from not knowing how to code to making a small webapp for their use.  Someone who wants to write backend and give them a decent front end, someone who whats to write front end and give them a decent backend.

Great take from someone with more experience than most can ever dream of having, worth a listen.
