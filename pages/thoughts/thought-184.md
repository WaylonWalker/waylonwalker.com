> Most bloggers on my twitter blog right into a file that goes on git.  I kinda expected to have more database folk.  I have my blog in markdown on git and the editing experience is top notch.  I can just find files edit them in MY EDITOR, push them and I got a post.  I am running thoughts in a sqlite database with a fastapi backend, and holy crap the instant nature of posting feels so much better.  Both sides have good points.
