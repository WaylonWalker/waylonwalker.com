👏👏👏 This one is really good. I'm right there with him on most of this.  I am very hesitant on subscription models, and all the ai tools feel like they are getting ready to be the next round of death by a thousand cuts, this time with pretty limited free tier and relatively high prices to run.  I'm sure we will see companies get taken by huge bills soon by building off of someone else's service.

On the flip side I'm definitely the guy that gets in a rut of just copy paste to the ai, wait for codeium to to inject.  I feel like I have issues of momentum more than anything.  When I'm on one side or the other I tend to stick it out for too long, but less so on going without because that llm drug is calling you when you hit a hard problem.

I'm excited to see him build out a homelab for llm stuff that he mentioned at the top.  I'm interested, but probably not building one out for myself until we start to see some cheaper maybe used hardware to do it.
