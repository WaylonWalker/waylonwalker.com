> This is a sick looking bash script generator for installing binaries off of github releases.  it reccomends curl into bash, but you could curl into install.sh  and toss that in your dotfiles repo or wherever.

Install installer with installer

``` bash
curl -s https://i.jpillora.com/installer | bash
```
