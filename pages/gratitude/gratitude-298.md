Long day at the theater.  So much got done.  It's looking so good.  I'm so proud of everyone.  Especially Rhiannon who has to step in as a build manager today with the bad weather a lot of people were not able to make it in.  Big thanks to the parents who took our kids to go play fun games for a few hours.  They had so much fun and did great.
