Today I completed the removal of the arch in our house, well mostly.  There
were a couple of 2x4's left that we will get later.  These have bothered
Rhiannon to her core since purchasing the house, its something she cant quite
explain, it just does.  In the middle of one of the arches we found this
message from the builder, aparantly he felt the same way about the arch, and we
thought that made it hilarious.  We have some water lines behind one of the
partial walls that we will need to re-build a new partial wall for, I think
this will make a great side to some built in shelving.
