> How many times in one video can Prime say dude just use arch, dude arch would be way easier, dude you know how hard you are making this on yourself.

I do not envy those who desire full size configurability but stuck with the opinions of GatesJobs.  Windows and Mac are so rigid, that it makes it impossible to do any level of customizability that I would want to do for productivity.

Unless you **Must** work on win/mack for some reason of work, you make something for one of them, you use Adobe, or you play competitive online multiplayer with easy anticheat there is a distro for you.  The number of things that you need a win/mack for is greatly shrinking, you don't have to submit yourself to the pain of Gates that this guy has done.
