Progress is being made on theater boxes.  We made one boo boo on not
redesigning after switching from 1/2" to 3/4" ply.  We are going to do a bit of
re cutting and they will turn out great.  Right now the tops don't fit.

Work lately has had 3 outages within the last week.  I'm so grateful that we
have been able to get through them with relative ease.  Some of them have been
out of our control and some due to a lack of transparency which we are
correcting for.
