I came across [faststream](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream) from [ag2ai](https://github.com/ag2ai), and it's packed with great features and ideas.

FastStream is a powerful and easy-to-use Python framework for building asynchronous services interacting with event streams such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS and Redis.
