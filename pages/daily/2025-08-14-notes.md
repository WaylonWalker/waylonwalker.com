Huge progress on [shots](https://waylonwalker.com/shots/) not to be confused
with [shots](https://shots.wayl.one) inspired by
<https://justin.searls.co/shots/>.  I'm building out my own instagram grid
design, right now its 4 wide, but I wonder if it should be 3 wide to match up
with the old instagram grid designs, and I could do cool crops like instagram
used to.

I went through a bunch of old [[ gratitude ]] posts and pulled images from all
of them, and update all of the images to use dropper while I was at it.

More work after kids bed time and came up with a great concept that needs to go
into markata, yes its more configuration.  [[ markata ]] is quickly becoming
death by config.  What I wanted was the ability to make different cards
different sizes.

What I came up with was adding "card_classes" to the front matter of the
markdown file.  This is a list of classes that will be added to the card div
when the card is rendered.  This way I can make cards different sizes.  Here
are a couple of good results I had.

Made a bit of cyberbrink crane progress, glued in a few cables and put the cab
on top of the tower.
