#### Playdate

Today We had a playdate for the kids.  While its good to get the kids out and interacting with others, its good for the adults as well.  I am not typically one to spring up an event with other adults, so its great that the kids drive that for us.  The adults were able to play a board game while the kids were playing.  I am very grateful that I was able to get out and enjoy some time with other adults, and that the kids had a really good afternoon.  The game we played was new to me and was a blast to play.
