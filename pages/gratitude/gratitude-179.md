I cannot believe that I went nearly an entire month witout posting here, well I
am back.  Habits are hard to change right, you are either in the flow or not,
but once you are on one side transitioning to the other is hard.  That theory
will hold up here.  It's time to get back into the things that I love to do.  I
really like taking just a few minutes per day to this journal and it will
continue to happen.

Today was a bit coastery,  we had some big highs and low lows, but overall the
lows were pretty short and we made it through and ended with a chipoltle treat.
Rhianon continued to kick some serious ass on all the house and installed a
brand new deadbolt.  It looks super nice and makes for a fantastic updtate to
our previous old one.
