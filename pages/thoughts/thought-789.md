> It's facinating how many people are making the jump from mac/windows, not just to linux, not just to archlinux, but to a full on tiling window manager.  DHH has omakub and omarchy.  Omakub is advertised as easy and for beginners, but many are skipping right over that to go straight for the hard stuff.

DHH mentions hyprland here, one thing I think he is missing is that this is the first real mainstream tiling window manager that is a competitor to i3, awesomewm, qtile  that runs Wayland.  I think they were able to pull a bunch of great benefits such as lack of screen tearing and animations from this.
