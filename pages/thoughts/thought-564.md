> I like Davids idea for cotton coder here, reminds me a lot of [[ thoughts ]], which turns out to be mroe commonly called a linkblog.  I can relate to David heavily on gathering too many side projects and soem collecting more digital dust than you would really like them to.  I use thoughts for quick publishing, very similar to David's [notes](https://dbushell.com/notes/).  I have tags and titles, but the titles are a reflection of the post I'm taking a note on.  They are short and sweet, I put just enough thought into them without overthinking them.  They live as a separate server hosted website, but the data gets pulled into my blog at build time, so they end up in the same place eventually.
