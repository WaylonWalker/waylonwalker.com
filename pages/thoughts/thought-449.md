> Damn I'm loving using dropper already, I am able to copy paste images right into posts on thoughts.  This is my first post that really utilizes them heavily to show how different styled rss feeds look in the post.  These were super quick to screenshot and paste in, this is a DREAM workflow for me.

When I paste an image into my thoughts chrome extension it automatically uploads it to dropper, and places a markdown image tag in its place.  Ya, I know the alt text could be better, but it feels _fine_ for quick and dirty posts like this.
