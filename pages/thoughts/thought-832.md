> When you fill all of your time with a bunch of other things, it becomes really hard to become a friendly person.  Prime talked about trying to learn how to drop the hurry in his life, and how to not always be in a frenzy of going from one thing to the next.  It's something that puts us in a state that its hard to remember to be friendly.  Hard to remember that [theres always time for coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgMeKfQFq8).

I do my best to always leave time for coffee, whether at home with my wife and kids, as well as at work.  I am in a very unique place at work where I have a rare set of skills for the industry I am in.  This comes with a lot of people insterested in how to do things like running data pipelines or managing server infrastructure.  I always take time for these conversations, I find them interesting, and useful.  Sometimes you end up with someone who asks the same questions every 6 months, other times, you have someone flourish from these conversations.  I'm not saying to take on work from every other team in the org, but giving 30 minutes to help mentor others can go a long ways.

I'm still not the best, I still get wrapped up in my own stuff just like prime calls out.  I sometimes get frustrated with others around me when things come up that prevent me from doing my work, or just getting the things out of my head that I had momentum on while the lightning was hot.
