> I need to find this podcast, was DHH this animated through the whole thing?

> You don't need a mentor. There's no secret sauce left inside anyone's head any more. It's all been tapped, bottled, tweeted, and shared a million times. Sample some of that, but also guard your ignorance. You'll lose it soon enough.

It takes work, one on one hand holding is a shortcut.  Sometimes one that we need.  Sometimes we need to level up quick, hence why your job might pair you up with someone for the first few months, but it is not something you need, you can figure shit out on your own with hard work.  These days we have things like gippity to bounce ideas off, and you can generally get the sense of the direction the average of the internet it was trained on.  Always add your own experience and make a choice for yourself.
