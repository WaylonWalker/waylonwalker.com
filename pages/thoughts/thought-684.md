> I thin a lot of us have this issues, **especially** on side projects.  At work therre are expectations, jira tickets and so on, keeping you shipping.  I think there is something to be said about getting that quick and dirty POC to the right group of people early for feedback before you add redis caching, kubernetes, auto scaling, disruption budget, distributed nodes, high availability, backups, disaster recovery.  At work you kinda  have to have the right person to shoot ideas by that can understand that you probably need some of these complex things for your app and it will take time to get right.
