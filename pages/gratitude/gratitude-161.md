Today we opened up the house for Dobby, so far he has been pretty confined to
his play pen and a few extra areas that were boarded up with boxes.  He has
done ok, but you could tell that he just wants to be with everyone.  He
absolutely loved it!  He was just sprinting around the house like a crazy pup.
There were definitely some hillarias slide outs on the tile floor.  Wyatt
especially loved having that extra space to run with him.  They did so well
together.
