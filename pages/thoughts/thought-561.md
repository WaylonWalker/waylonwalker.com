I can't believe I've never see this Tim Berners-Lee quote, but I can't unsee it and will be required to reference it from now on.

> eventually every URL ends up as a porn site

I had a friend let his blog domain expire, within a short period it was scooped up and was hosting porn.  I don't know why, but my best guess is that they were holding it ransom with the most embarrassing content to have your personal site replaced with.
