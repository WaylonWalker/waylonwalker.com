DT says it so well in this video, I've never really been one to shit on software projects, with maybe a VERY small handful of exceptions.  The shitting on ubuntu always rubbed me wrong, shitting on flatpak and snap I never got, shitting on systemd because of Leonard Pottering I never got, DT puts it in such good words here.  If you don't like it you are probably not the target audience.  

If Ubuntu is too bloated, don't try to debloat it, this is not windows, we have options, Ubuntu is one option and so much is intertwined together in something like Ubuntu if you think you want to try to _"debloat"_ it good luck.  If you have a problem with Snaps, this is probably not for you.  You are probably looking for a distro with more control, probably something that you choose everything for.
