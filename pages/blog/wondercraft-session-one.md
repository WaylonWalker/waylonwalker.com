My son and I are starting a new Minecraft server today called wondercraft.

## setup

We are running a few mods on this server notably FTB Ultimine for less grindy
resource gathering, Sodium for shaders, and Universal Shops.

We are runninng on Minecraft 1.20.1, I _think_ this is because it was the
latest supported by Universal Shops, its at least one major release old at this
point.

I grabbed a few shaders, the ones that you see in this post are rethinking
voxels.

## spawn

We initially spawned in a plains biome near an acacia and forest biome.  We
ended up going straight for the forest, only coming back for some sheep and
wheat seeds.

## Night one Zombie fight

On the first night we had the obligitory zombie fight before getting beds and bases set.

## Salmon Wrangler

I was the designated food provider.  I setup a small wheat farm with about 64
seeds, then went out to hunt down some salmon for the immediate food need.  I
ended up with about a stack of salmon at the end of the session.

## Setting up Shop

So as mentioned above we are running a mod for shops called universal shops.
This mod is new to me and my son wanted to run it inspired by watching
hermitcraft.  We both decided that diamonds were the goal currency, but we
wanted to set up some shops early so we settled on Oak logs as the currency.
My job was to setup food based shops while he set up ore based shops.

## First Death

I forgot that I turned my sound off for a call, got lost on the chase of the
salmon and did not leave myself enough time to get to the top.

## Second Death

Playing sloppy again I was walking around at night with only three hearts left.
My son wanted me to check out his shop that he just built out and I got hit by
a skelly on the way up, after the first hit I was sitting at 1 heart with no
where to go.

## Third Death

This one is just plain embarrasing, I was lost in the flow of hunting salmon
again, not paying any attention.  I came up for air, but didn't even gie time
for more than a couple bubbles to come back before diving back in and died
almost instantly.
