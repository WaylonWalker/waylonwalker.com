2018 was a year of many ups and downs, and learning to deal with a whole new set of problems professionally and at home.  In 2018 I logged in to my first Linux system, setup my own webserver, data pipelines, database. I learned to use react and d3. Stepped up my python, javascript, and sql.

At home the doctor appointments keep piling in.  While I am learning to deal with it all there were several times throughout the year that I was very overwhelmed  with everything and broke down.


Here are the goals I had listed out for 2018 and how I faired at completing them.

### Positivity

#### The Good


---
* Continue "Favorite Things" with family at dinner time
* Take 2 10min breaks per day clear the mind

---

I can say that the kids are fully on board with favorite things and love to tell everyone about how their day went.  This is a time that they are very positive and generally give praise to another family member for helping them through their day.


#### To Be Improved
---

* Gratitude journaling every day
* Snooze Less be productive

---

I hit 61  gratitude journals in 2018.  I would not say that I met my goal, but I would definitely say that it's a great start and is something that I plan on improving next year.  I really like how it helps me focus on the positive things that happened throughout the day to find the best gratitude journal subject.  I do think the quick five minute deadline helps in that I have to be semi-prepared, which forces me to think about gratitude throughout the day.

### Focus

Mediocore performance??

---

* 8 pomodoro
* up to date kanban
* daily/weekly planning session

---

In 2018 I wanted to set out some goals to be more focused with the time that I do have at work.  I did quite a bit of research for the best techniques throughout December, and found a system that works well for me.  I did keep up with the _kanban_ system througout the year with trello.  I did not live by the board, but i did put things on there and move them.  The big thing that I found with this system is that it really made me **feel** productive, and gave me motivation to keep going.  While tracking my tasks throughout the day I was able to really see progress at the end of the day, and go home knowing I did some good work rather than feeling "Where did this day go?".

> I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.

I completely fell off of the pomodoro system.  I really feel like this system works for me and keeps me on task, I really have issues with task jumping.  It is really hard to keep on it when there are so many distractions throughout the day.  I am putting this back in for 2019, and I will learn to concur them.  The biggest challenge is people.  I have a lot of people stop by for a quick answer or to chat about a project.  I really need to set strong boundaries and tell them in X minutes I can talk, right now I am busy.

### Physical Health

---

* active 3 days a week... 🤔
* eat better 👍

---

I will admit that I was not very measurable with "eat better", but I would say that I have done well.  I have really incorporated quite a few more vegetables into my diet, even when everyone else at the table isn't.  I throw some frozen brocoli in the microwave.  I have even started choosing vegan options at restaurants occasionally.

> As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.

I started running in the March timeframe, and really enjoyed it.  As different things started taking over my time I was back off the wagon.  Overall I would say that I am still active 3 or so days of the week with the kids.

### Educational

Continuous Learning is something that I am really passionate for.  I truly believe in always learning from experiences, taking classes, watching conferences, listening to podcasts and reading blogs

#### The Good 👍

_4 official courses completed_

---

* d3 in 5 days
* flexbox zombies
* cssgrid.io
* datacamp sql
* linux command line (many blogs/youtube... not a course)

---

I really stepped up my **front end web skills** this past year. I have started using es6, react, and building interactive web visualizations, laid out with native modern css.  These are things that I loosely understood in the past and really relied on libraries like `bokeh` or `dash` to get them to work right.

I can also say that I have stopped google searching for every simple sql query that I write, Goal Complete.  I would say that I went beyond my sql goal in that I have learned to do far more than I realized was possible in the database, dramatically improving performance of my products.  I have also become the go to guy for reading/writing more complex queries.

> Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.

Before 2018 I had never experienced the glory of the linux command line.  Around May I was graced with a small on premis red hat virtual machine and my mind was quickly blown.  Many things that I have struggled to get up and working on windows simply worked right out of the box.  Webserver, task scheduling, 100% availability, and a great command line.  By the end of the year I installed Debian (wsl) on my windows machine and have converted all of my command line applications/languages to run from there, as there are far fewer compatability issues..

#### The flop
_planned coursed not completed_

---

* R
* Machine Learning

---

Honestly I am not really hurt by not completing this one.  I really feel like I learned a ton of useful skills this year and I feel like neither of these two would have helped me progress.  R is too close to python to need both in my toolbelt without a specific project/need for it.  I did not have any projects with a dire need for ML.  I really hope to start getting some experience with it so I can have a better understanding when I should use it, but it was not a big need in any of my projects this year.


Overall I am really happy with the progress from this year, and can't wait to get started next year.  Having the past few weeks off has really given me time for a reset that I didn't realize I needed.  Looking at these goals reminds me of the things that had started slipping towards the end during that last hard push to the end.


🎉🎉 Hapy New Year 🎉🎉
