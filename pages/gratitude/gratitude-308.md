title: Gratitude 308

The sickness rolls onward, the afternoons are hard.  I feel achy and tired, I
push through, get kids to bed and I feel myself still tired, but like I've
pushed through and no longer am ready to sleep.

I did make it through a work presentation today that I think went really well.
Our team presented to another on how we do things in a similar space.  We got
some decent discussion going, but it feels like theres something about the half
in half out that really does not foster good discussion.  I really feel like we
get better discussions all one way or another.  In this case we had people from
all over the country, there was no way we were going to all be in the same
room.  The POSITIVES though, keeping it positive here.  Presentation went well
and it was well recieved.  I am very grateful that my cough and my energy held
up throughout the presentation.

Tonight I worked on my website, I used [[ krayt ]] to successfully diagnose an
issue on the build and got build times back down under 20s!  I got OG images
all looking good, with and without images, at a wide variety of sizes.  I did a
lot of good things for them to clean up the process, adding HEAD requests to
shots, jpg format, none of that fixed my issues of signal desktop not rendering
them, but I'm glad it's all better anyways.
