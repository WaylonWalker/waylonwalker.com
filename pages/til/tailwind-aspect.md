I've been back to putting some images on my blog lately and thinking about
making them a bit thinner through the use of aspect ratio for simplicity.  I'm
leaning pretty heavy on tailwindcss these days due to some weird quirks of
markdown-it-attrs I cannot have slashes in classes from markdown so I made a
`.cinematic` class to achieve this.

``` css
.cinematic {
  @apply aspect-[2.39/1];
}
```

Example
