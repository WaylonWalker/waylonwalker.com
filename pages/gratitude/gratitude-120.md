title: Gratitude 120

Holy nother day! This process is moving so fast, this morning we stepped
into the house that we have been looking for.  It's honestly one that
has came up several times in our searches over the past while and we
keep saying we really like it, but its only for sale.  Now we are trying
to buy it!!  We already have our offer drafted and submitted.  We got a
lot of paperwork to sift through, and some big decisions to think about.
I am so grateful that this one came up and just looks so perfect for us.
It's outside of Peoria a little ways and in a much less competitive
market.
