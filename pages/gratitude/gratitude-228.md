Summer time pool time. We've been back to going to the pool semi daily, the
kids have a blast and get lots of energy out even on these super hot days where
it's hard to get outside in the heat of the day.  Both kids are really learning
to swim quite well this year and hit the pool with all the skills they had last
year immediately like they never took a break.  They are both already
progressing past where they were just after going twice this year.  I am so
proud of them and so grateful that we have this pool that we are able to go to.
