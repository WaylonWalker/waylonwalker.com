> I hit an issue with markata where even though a bunch of articles were cached, the site build was still slow because I was hitting hashlib.sha256 so hard for cache keys.  I was shocked when this popped up in my profiler as a significant portion of the time spent.  I swapped out for xxhash and that issue completely went away.
