> Browsing for the minio tag that I have running right now I discovered that you can do `minio --version` and you get the same version that matches the docker tag, this is super convenient and helpful.  I also notice that they use timestamped version numbers.  I kinda dont mind this.  It feels easy to understand how far behind it is. I really appreciate that the version in the container matches the version inside the container.

It's not as pretty or flexible as semver, it does not communicate trees of majors and minors, but how often do we continue supporting/patching older majors and minors, in my experience only really big teams or teams with sufficient motivation are doing this. 

food for thought.
