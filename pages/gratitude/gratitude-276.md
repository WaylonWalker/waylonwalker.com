Chill day, nothing pressing that needs done in a rush.  Started cleaning up my
office and desk after a long period of projects and inability to do it.  It's
got a long ways to go, but already feels so much nicer in here.  Made more
progress in SilkSong with Wyatt,  I had to help him past Sister Splinter, which
unlocks a whole set of new areas in the map with wall jump.

Just dropped my first post in a little while, feels good to document progress
on some things like [[ 3d-printing-dovetails-experiment ]].

Oh and I didn't journal yesterday, but we played a good couple of games of Flux
with Ayla and had a blast.  I really enjoy those game nights as a family.  It
can be so hard as the kids never seem to agree and wont both play.  It's also
hard to put the phone down when I think of things and want to take note or look
something up right away, but its good to do.
