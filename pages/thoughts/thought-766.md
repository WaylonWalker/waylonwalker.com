> Ben sold me on the mini pocket pry here.  It's funny how so many _minimalist_ tools become over the top titanium damascus with wild patterns and designs. they look amazing, but are they worth the insane price for simple things?  I like my edc to be things I don't worry about breaking, loosing, or giving away.  Fancy ass prybars for $200+ gives me all of those negative feelings I don't want on my edc.
