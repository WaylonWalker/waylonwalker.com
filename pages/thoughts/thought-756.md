> big fan of eza and dust, I like these aliases to have some common commands at my fingertips.  I often use the tree command and yes it sometimes goes too deep to actually be useful.

``` bash
    alias lt='eza -T --level=2'             # Tree view, 2 levels deep
    alias ltt='eza -T --level=3'            # Tree view, 3 levels deep

    alias du1='dust -d 1'                   # Show only 1 level deep
    alias du2='dust -d 2'                   # Show 2 levels deep
```
