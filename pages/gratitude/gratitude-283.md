Today was a bit of a rough afternoon.  I got a migraine while at work.  I am so
grateful that I had the time and opportunity to lay down eyes closed for a bit.
I am grateful that we have a small community carpool to get Ayla to practice.
I am grateful that my migraine cleared, I was able to spend some quality time
with Wyatt and drive to pick up Ayla afterwards.
