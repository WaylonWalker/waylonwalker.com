I can't believe this thing is so devicive.  I kinda can't belive that I sit on the same side as Mathes and his always against the grain, non corporate influenced response.  So many others have praised Haiden for bringing back the real gladiator bloodsport that SX is, is it that though??  It's a race to the finish.  different than a lot of other racing its very unpredictable takeout moves happen, occasionally as an accident, often taking both riders down at the same time.  

Also different than MANY sports we have a huge industry of weekend warriors, Some of which make it into the night show of the biggest race on TV.  You see we only bring 20 riders from each class, the top half to top quarter are "Factory" riders, the rest are privateers, sometimes these privateers are completely their on their own.  

There is also something called a last chance qualifier.  This is your last chance to get into the night show, often fought by these privateers out of box vans with their brother as a mechanic.  Often that last spot is filled by sketchy on edge riding and takeout moves from a rider that looks like he is barely making it, but would run circles around anyone at your local race.

We celebrate these as a fight to the finish, anything goes, you just gotta cross the finishline.

What's different here from last weekend (someone could really write a book on the build up of tension, shit talking, lack of harsh penalties in the rules) is really that Haiden had zero shot at the championship.  He was winning the race, Joe in Second with a secure championship.  This is when Haiden started riding behind him, slowing down for Joe to catch up, and taking shots at Joe until he broke his own collarbone.  He went out knowing he needed to knock Joe down enough to cover the points deficit and the penalty.  This was not a pass for the win, or a pass for the last spot in the night show, this was a pass to clear a deficit which required Joe on the ground.

This seems to be celebrated by half the industry, but dude you had already lost going into this night this aint cool, you lost this one put on a face let Joe have his moment, make your statement by going one one and crushing these dudes by 30 seconds metaphorically, not literally crushing them.
