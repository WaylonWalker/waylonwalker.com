Today was a battle of the pharmacy, actually they were absolutely fantastic, it
was more about getting busy doctors to submit forms quickly so that we didn't
miss medicine doses since they accidentally hit not approve on some forms.  At
the last hour of the day we got the pharmacy to get us a few days of emergency
fill since it is not controlled, but by the time we picked it up the doc had
sumbitted everything.  Seriously someone needs to build a better system for
this stuff, a lot of it still runs on fax.  I thought fax was dead when I was a
kid let alone now having critical things built on it.  I am so grateful for our
pharmacists pushing it through and getting it filled so quickly.  It'd not
necessarily their job and these days it can be hard to find someone to fight
for you through these things rather than pushing you down the line.
