I had no idea that you could just drop an msi installer right in steam.  This worked for me, and was much easier to install pokemon tcg live in 05-2024 on ubuntu 22-04.  I added the msi to steam from my downloads, hit start, failed right away like he said it would.  changed compatability to proton experimental, and it opened right up.

* Download the official installer from pokemon tcg
* Add non steam game
* click show all file types
* navigate to downloaded msi
* click gear icon > compatability > proton experimental
* click play
* profit
