title: Gratitude 167

Today felt felt a bit like a busy one.  It all goes back a few weeks ago
to when I was cleaning out and installing washer and dryer.  I had
pushed the washer in and out like 3 times.  well on the last time I
decided not I probably was not done yet and I was not going to button it
up.  Instead I would leave it out a few inches and not install the drain
hose, because it was probably coming back out soon again anyways.
Weeealll.... I kinda forgot about this later as I finished mopping up
and decided to just nudge it back into place on my way out.


So today I wake up to a backed up sink, and after many hours of trying
to unclog it, I go to the basement to explore for another cleanout
somewhere.  Maybe there is something down here that can reach the clog.
Well to my surprise I walk into the guest bedroom to find two ceiling
tiles on the floor, about a dozen ruined, along with some mattress
sheets.  At first I was in complete disbelief of what I was actually
looking at, until I remembered what had happened a few weeks ago.

I am so grateful that it simply dropped through some ceiling tiles, and
onto a tiled floor.  Made for not too bad of a cleanup.  Now as a
homeowner I get to fix it and now answer to a landlord.

Lesson learned, water on the floor equals check the basement.
