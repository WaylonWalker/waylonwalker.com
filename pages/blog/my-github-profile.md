title: How I Built My GitHub Profile

I ran a discussion on dev that collected quite a list of examples in the comment section.  So many great calls to action, animations, memes, and weird tricks.

## My current profile

## social icons

Upload all of your icons to the repo in a directory such as `icons` or `assets`, then link them with a `height` attribute like below.  I used html for mine, not sure if you can set the `height` in markdown.

``` markdown
<a href="https://dev.to/waylonwalker"><img height="30" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WaylonWalker/WaylonWalker/main/icon/dev.png"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
```

**note** I did add a bit of `&nbsp;` (non-breaking-whitespace) between my icons.  Without adding css this seemed like the simplest way to do it.

## Center

Aligning things in the center of the readme is super simple.  I used this trick to align my social icons in the middle.

``` markdown
<p align='center'>
 ...html
</p>

```

## right

For my [latest post](https://waylonwalker.com/latest) I floated it to the right with a little bit of `align='right'` action.

``` markdown
<p>
  <a href="https://images.waylonwalker.com/latest"><img width="400" align='right' src="https://waylonwalker.com/latest.png?raw=true"></a>
</p>
```

You may need to play with where you put this in the document, and the size of elements to get things to flow right.

## redirects

In order to keep my latest post always up to date on my readme I implemented a netlify redirect to always point to my latest post.  As a digital gardener this helps me keep pointed to a the best one in my opinion.  Any automated way would pick up half finished posts.

```
# /static/_redirects
# netlify redirects

# latest post
/latest            /blog/kedro-catalog-search/
/latest.png        /kedro-catalog-search.png
```

Now I can reference both the post and the post cover image.

## summary/details

I also wanted to list out a few of my favorite posts without taking up a ton of space, so I used `details` and `summary` tags so that it would collapse.


``` markdown
<details>
 <summary><strong>other favorite posts</strong></summary>
 <a href="https://images.waylonwalker.com/eight-years-cat/"><img width="400" src="https://waylonwalker.com/eight-years-cat.png?raw=true"></a>
 <a href="https://images.waylonwalker.com/keyboard-driven-vscode/"><img width="400" src="https://waylonwalker.com/alt%20b.png?raw=true"></a>
 <a href="https://images.waylonwalker.com/what-are-github-actions/"><img width="400" src="https://waylonwalker.com/what-are-github-actions.png?raw=true"></a>

</details>
```
