Today i got hit by this accessibility issue on my site.  Low contrast links are
not distiniquishable.  I had not seen this error title before it was new to me,
maybe I have bad memory or maybe it's new to me.

I ended up dropping the background color of the site down a notch as I didn't
really care for the semi-dark brown anyways.  I'm liking the near black
`bg-zinc-950` much better now.

Now I got that 100 A11y score in lighthouse.
