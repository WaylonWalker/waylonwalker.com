We lost the house we were really dreaming of today. It's been tough.  I think
the toughest part is that we are going to have to spend more to get a house
that we don't love as much.  This system sucks.

On the bright side, we found a house that we do really like.  One that if we
hadn't seen the other would really feel a whole lot better about.  It's
actually really close and checks a lot of the boxes that our family wants.
Fingers crossed this one is not a crazy as the last.
