My next step into django made me realize that I do not have access to the admin panel, turns out that I need to create a cuper user first.

## Run Migrations

Right away when trying to setup the superuser I ran into this issue

``` bash
django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: auth_user
```

Back to the [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/)
tells me that I need to run migrations to setup some tables for the
`INSTALLED_APPS`, `django.contrib.admin` being one of them.

``` bash
python manage.py migrate
```

``` bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The super user has been created.

## CSRF FAILURE

My next issue trying to run off of a separate domain was a cross site request
forgery error.


Since this is a valid domain that we are hosting the app from we need to tell
Django that this is safe.  We can do this again in the `settings.py`, but this
time the variable we need is not there out of the box and we need to add it.

```
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ['https://localhost.waylonwalker.com']
```

## I made it!!

And we are in, and welcomed for the first time with this django admin panel.

## Remote Hosting

You might find these settings helpful as well if you are trying to run your
site on a remote host like aws, digital ocean, linode, or any sort of cloud
providor.  I had it running in my home lab while I was out of the house and
ssh'd in over with a chromebook.
