> Never believe in absolutes, see what I did there.  The hype bros will take you to the extremes, ai will take your jobs in six months or be burned to the ground in six months.  How about its useful now and will be more useful in six months.  If you turned off the hype bro feed for six months you would probably be fine, in fact you would probably be better off for not capturing so much noise along the way.  AI has gone the way of next js framework, it churns fast, hype bros are always an expert that know exactly whats best for everyone.  It changes fast, what was the best last week might be dead next week.  In fact getting to know what works well for you and knowing that tool really well for a longer period will take you farther.
