David's got me looking at Forgejo.  I've seen a lot of GitHub jumpers just this week, and I've been tempted for a long time to self host one anyways, so it might be time.  I don't have hard issues with anything, I just like self hosting my own personal stuff.

On the flipside, I hope this does not turn yet another thing to shit.  I lived through the download software from sourceforge and hope you get the right download now button and not the one from the virus ad.  I'm not putting my really public/useful projects on a self hosted platform... well not as the **only** source, I see how that comes off edgy.  I like having some trust in the platform.  Currently theres a lot of issues with M$ and GitHub using you for your data, but I don't think injecting virus, malware, bitcoin miners is a worry I have coming from a GitHub release, unless it was put there by the author.
