What a nightmare this glossary plugin turns out to be, it broke my site.  I had
it really close, then one more change asked for to the llm, an LGTM and did not
look close, it rewrote the whole thing and started rendering markdown with its
own renderer not my configured markdown renderer.  Its close to working not but
moved to post_render and using html/beautifulsoup rather than the raw markdown.
