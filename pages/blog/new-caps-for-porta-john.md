Today I dropped some new caps in the porta-john.  I need to do a bunch of
posts on zmk and my journey building the porta-john, I've been rocking it for
at least two weeks now pretty solid and I am absolutely loving it.  More on
that later.

## KLP-Lame-Keycaps

The model of the caps are
[KLP-Lame](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps) by
[braindefender](https://github.com/braindefender) , they are super rounded and
smooth.  They look really good on camera and feel good to the finders.

I printed these at home on my ender3 s1 pro with a black and purple silk
filliment.  I printed all 42 at once using a [[knock-and-sweep]] technique.
They do have just a bit of a rough texture that you can feel on your figertips.
I printed these on super quality .12mm layer height, while my last set was
printed on draft quality .32mm layer height.  They look crazy different in
print quality with the lines of the new caps barely showing, the feel isn't
nearly as drastic.

## The Result

Check out the final shots as I set up the porta-john with these sweet caps.

And here they are all set up.
