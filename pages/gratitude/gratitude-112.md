title: Gratitude 112

Today was Chemo day for Rhiannon, and a rough one at that.  We did get a
whole box of Casey's delicious doughnuts and cookies to enjoy together.
That only goes so far towards seeing her suffer continuously all day.  I
am just grateful that its only like this for one day every month, in
another day or two she will be back to her best, but today is her worst.
It's not easy being the one caught between caring for everyone, but we
all make due and try our best to give Mama some extra love and support
on this one day each month.
