First release of `nvim-manager` is out. Your dotfiles change a lot, sometimes it's hard to manage all of the places you have installed them and potentially made hand edits to. nvim-manager allows you to easily make static releases of your dotfiles, and keep your nvim install from breaking by leveraging NVIM_APPNAME and pinned releases of your dotfiles stored in ~/.config. In this directory you might have many nvim configurations installed, nvim-manager automates the process of installing and updating from your dotfiles, while keeping previous pinned versions untouched.
