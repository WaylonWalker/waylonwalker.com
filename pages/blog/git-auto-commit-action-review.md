It's a really cool GitHub action that will automatically commit files changed
during the action. I was using this to render a new readme based on a template.

Check out the repo for [git-auto-commit-action](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action).

It's a really cool GitHub action that will automatically commit files changed during the action.  I was using this to render a new readme based on a template.

This has been by far the easiest way to commit back to a repo that I have seen.  Other patterns often require fully setting up the git user and everything.  While it's not all that hard, this action already has all of that covered.

You must give it a commit message and thats it.  Optionally you can configure a number of things.  Its possible to configure the `commit_user_name`, `commit_user_email`, and `commit_author`.  I often also scope the `file_pattern` to a certain subset of files.

You do need to be careful to checkout the repo just a bit different than normal.


## Limitations & Gotchas
_directly from the repo_

### Checkout the correct branch

You must use `action/checkout@v2` or later versions to checkout the repository. In non-push events, such as pull_request, make sure to specify the ref to checkout:

``` yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

You have to do this do avoid that the `checkout`-Action clones your repository in a detached state.

## Usage
_from the repo_

``` yaml
- uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
  with:

    # - https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec
    file_pattern: src/*.js tests/*.js

    # Optional local file path to the repository
