I love this idea of tiny useful apps for yourself.  In fact I'm working on a project to built out [[ tinyapps ]] for myself to replace my common needs.  I absolutely love that all of the state is stored in the url bar, nothing is stored server side.  As much as I love to hate js, I really appreciate that things like this can be built to just live on the web, be accessible from anywhere, and live practically forever as they require such little hosting demand.
