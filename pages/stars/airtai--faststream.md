[faststream](https://github.com/airtai/faststream) by [airtai](https://github.com/airtai) is a game-changer in its space. Excited to see how it evolves.

FastStream is a powerful and easy-to-use Python framework for building asynchronous services interacting with event streams such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS and Redis.
