title: Gratitude 215

---

I am grateful for the ability to create really cool and useful things out of
almost thin air with 3d printing at home.  This morning I modeled this
microphone mount for my desk in about 15minutes, printed it and it worked first
try!  I'm really getting the hang of my printer tolerances and what it will
spit out.  I may not have things perfect first try, but this one was easy
enought that it was.  In the beginning I tended to make things a bit too tight,
but giving an extra half mm or so generally gives good slip fit for the
printer.
