New Tricks, we have a trampoline in our backyard.  We had one in 2023, but 2024
it was broken and out of use, and again this year we are back to having one.
There is something about going out with the kids and working on new tricks that
is very satisfying.  Lately Ayla has really been getting good at handsprings,
Wyatt and I are working on different ways to break down tricks that are small
steps in between what she knows and things that we can do.

Tonight was the first time where Wyatt got a trick that we are working on
together ahead of me and had to break down what he is doing.  It was a back
bounce front flip, we are not on feet yet, but more of a roll out.  It takes a
lot of spin from a really awkward angle and commitment.  We took a slow motion
video and broke down what steps he is doing when and I got it, only a few days
after him.  I am really grateful for these days where we are somewhat on par
with things like this, I know this overlap is short lived.  It goes quickly
from kids learning to walk, jump, and tumble, to double front flip wizards.
