I came across [checkbox](https://github.com/canonical/checkbox) from [canonical](https://github.com/canonical), and it's packed with great features and ideas.

Checkbox is a testing framework used to validate device compatibility with Ubuntu Linux. It’s the testing tool developed for the purposes of the Ubuntu Certification program.
