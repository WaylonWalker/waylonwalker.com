So much for better sleep, we made it to 2:00 am before kids were up.
They were exhausted today, fingers crossed for tomorrow.I

Today I played a new game with wyatt called 0A.D its a real time
strategy game similar to Age of Empires, we had a blast.  Honestly its
probably more up my alley than his so I don't see us playing it too
much.  It was fun to mix up our normal Minecraft time with something
new, but it was pretty complicated and a completely new category of game
so it was quite overwhelming with new content, and felt very fast paced.
