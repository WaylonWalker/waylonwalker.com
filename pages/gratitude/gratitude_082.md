#### Working Remotely

I am so grateful that I am working in a space in which I can work remotely often.  As a mechanical engineer I really struggled.  Our team was really structured for onsite work, and did not play well for remote folks.  Moving into data science, as long as I have a good connection to the data I need I can be productive from anywhere.  Actually Sometimes I find there to be fewer distractions at home.  Generally I work from home due to someone else's medical needs.  Today was different, my voice is completely gone.  This winter has been a rough one.  I am so grateful that I can cancel all of my meetings, push them to next week and take time to heal.  I can also put my head down and get some great work done without needing to use my voice.
