Today started off good, but the coughing is kicking in this afternoon, its a bit rough.  Glad that the energy is coming back more and more, but dang some of the coughing fits are rough.  I have all of the parts of my next keyboard printed and its feeling good.  The one that I'm on right now feels great, but this one is really going to feel nice.  It was printed strong n slow, and will be sanded down smooth.  Its going to take awhile but will be worth it, its going to last.  

Yesterday I got the flu shot on top of already having the flu, not sure how they double in, but whoof last night I was tired, got to sleep early and slept hard.  I woke up in quite a daze a few times.
