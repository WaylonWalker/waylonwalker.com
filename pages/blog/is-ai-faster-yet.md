Is AI making us more productive yet, more faster yet?

## Non-code 

_probably not_

I've seen this question hitting all over the Internet lately, and often points
to people not writing code.  Copilot turns prompts into emails, emails back
into summaries that look a lot like prompts. I think there's a place for this,
making rambled thoughts sound more coherent, summarizing notes and meeting
minutes.  All good stuff but does it make us more productive, probably not by
an amount that you can put $ $ behind, unless you are reducing headcount.
_thats not what we are doing right???_

## Coding

When we talk about chatbots like gippity I think there's a benefit to having
someone with jr skills in everything to talk to, someone who can read all of
the docs in an instant to get you some code snippet that might have taken all
day to research and get right, but more productive, probably not.

## Agentic Coding

I've hit a stride with coding agents this year unlike I've hit before.  Its
able to hang out huge swaths of code in a prompt, with a good enough spec/plan.
It absolutely curns out code.  The bottleneck quickly becomes UAT[1] is it
correct
