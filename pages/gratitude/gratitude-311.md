It's Saturday, and round one of Supercross is about to start.  I love this time
of year and am ready to enjoy some good racing.  I'm sad that Jet is out, but
from what I know there is a lot of guys coming in healthy.  A lot on new teams.

Had a lot of fun today with kids, we worked on painting, Don't Starve Together,
and DND.  I made some more keyboard progress.  I'm about to start printing out
a new one.  This one is supposed to be a clone of the last one with some issues
fixed.  I want two really good working ones that are clones of each other.

Tonight Wyatt went out with Mom to the grocery store and sent me the most
heartwarming message while he was out.  Sometimes taking kids to the grocery
store is not the easiest thing.  It gets complicated, things don't go quick and
smooth.  Everyone ends up frustrated and what was an intent to have a nice
journey out with them turns into regret.  Based on the message I got this was
nothing even close to that, it was a memory of a great trip with Mom, maybe
even a core memory for him.
