> This is a super cool movement, I like the idea of giving access to composable components like we have in open source.  You want to build a website you have a bunch of options from raw dogging assembly all the way up to predefined templates that just need your content.  Idk if the analogy is perfect but there are aspects of it that work.  I see where right now we are somewhere in raw dogging c or python.   We have cheap nuts and bolts and some low level things, but once someone needs some coupler like this it's dropping down to drawing it by hand.
