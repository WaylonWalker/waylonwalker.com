Yesterday I started building out some qrcode tooling for myself starting with
[qrcode.waylonwalker.com](https://qrcode.waylonwalker.com/).  This is part of
my [[ tinyapps ]] project.

Also dug into [[ qr-codes-in-python ]] to try to get some easy and small
qrcodes that I could add to my blog posts for others who find a post on desktop
and want to open on mobile.

This is what I am going for with qrcodes on my blog posts.
