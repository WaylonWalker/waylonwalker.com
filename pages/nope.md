# /nope

Things I don't like, avoid, or won't do.

## Tools & Tech I Avoid

**JavaScript/Node Ecosystem**

- Bloated `node_modules` - "got tired of bloated Node modules" so I built my own site generator
- npm fragility - dependencies that break constantly
- [I don't like that I need to install Tailwind with npm](/blog/a-case-for-tailwindcss)

**Slow Stuff**

- oh-my-zsh - removed it when I saw 5.5s startup time
- Heavy IDEs like VS Code - "why I stopped using @code"
- Command palettes as primary interface - "command palettes are slow, and overrated"
- Anything that makes me wait

**AI Agents (For Now)**

- [I'm out on agents for production code](/blog/im-out-on-agents)
- "They take the fun out of creation"
- "It's Average at best"
- I will be late on letting agents touch my production code bases

**curl | bash**

- "I don't like curl to bash from random sites"
- Always read the script first

## Practices I Skip

**Social Media Engagement**

- "I hate how social media has become very much trigger engagement bait"
- Algorithm-driven content
- Performance for likes

**Return-to-Office Mandates**

- "As much as I hate it, we are doing it [RTO]"
- I'll do it, but I won't enjoy it

**Overly Complex Solutions**

- Kubernetes for simple blogs (unless you want to learn)
- Microservices when a monolith works fine
- "Just add another service" architecture

**JavaScript Hoisting**

- [I don't hoist](/blog/do-you-hoist)
- Write code that reads top-to-bottom

**Publishing Everything**

- I [refuse to publicly share my LinkedIn work history](/blog/my-linked-in-work-history)
- Some things stay private
- Not everything needs to be content

## Communication Patterns I Dislike

**The Word "Just"**

- "Just use this library"
- "Just deploy to Kubernetes"
- "Just" skips all the invisible complexity
- Read my post on [why "just" is a problem](/blog/just)

**"One Size Fits All" Testing**

- [Unit tests don't make sense everywhere](/blog/thoughts-on-unit-tests)
- Not every project needs 100% coverage
- Context matters

## AI Industry Criticism

- "Techbrophobic" about AI hype
- Dislike the exploitation in AI training data
- AI art tools that are "all or nothing prompt engineering"
- The "disrupt everything" mindset without ethics

## What I Barely Use

- Vimium browser extension - "I don't use it a ton"
- Most Chrome extensions beyond my core few
- GUI file managers (terminal all the way)

## Philosophy of Nope

**If the tools are better than you, stop using them.**

This applies to vibe coding, AI agents, and anything that removes your understanding of what you're building.

**Don't pretend.**

I don't know everything. I won't fake expertise. I'll say when something confuses me or when I changed my mind.

**Complexity has a cost.**

Every abstraction, every dependency, every "just" - they all add up. I prefer systems I can understand and fix when they break.
