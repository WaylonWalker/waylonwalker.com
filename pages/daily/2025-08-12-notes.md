Sad day yesterday.  We discovered that our freezer was left cracked over a day
or so.  Kids self serviced themselves to some sausage dogs at some point and
wedged the box in the door.  Everything was over 40F and done.

Lessons learned for everyone.  For the kids, see something say something, food
should not come out of a freezer soft and barely fridge temp.  For the parents,
don't get in a rush when loading the freezer.  If something doesn't quite look
like it's going to stay out, it probably won't and next person to use it will
pay... Or you will pay when they don't notice.  Last lesson for everyone, when
you come home late and tired from a family trip to Grandma's and hear beeping
it's probably important and investigate.

I need some more ram... Was waiting out prime day, prices went up and haven't
gone down.

locally, create repos with curl, git push, actions working with multiple
runners.
