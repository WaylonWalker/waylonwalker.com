Yes

Ok we should probably dive deeper into this, but good chance if you are here
and have made it this far you it would probably be a fine choice.  The choice
is quite time and skill dependant.

## Time

First thing up, if you like copy pasting thing into your homelab, changing a
few config options, but mostly running it as the docs instructed, kubernetes is
not for you.  The homelab/self hosting space is heavily reliant on docker
compose, 90% of the things you want to run will likely have a docker command,
and likely a docker compose example that you can copy paste and get running
right away.  Maybe 5% of projects have something for kubernetes, you Will have
to do it yourself.

> Kubernetes is **very** DIY in the self hosting space, and not very plug and play.
