Had a fun evening with Wyatt on the trampoline.  The weather was beautiful and
we had a blast, I am so grateful to be able to enjoy this weather, and have the
ability to keep up with him and jump on a trampoline with him through his
childhood.  This is not something my parents were really able to do with me,
and I'm sure so many others out there are not either.  I cherish these moments
and try not to take them for granted.
