        Great tips in this one.  They discuss everything from front end to backend, databases and ORMS, here are a few of my favorite points.

* Use good data or good fake data
  * make it have some variation like long and short text
* Don't use a database if you need one, static content is eaiser to manage
* end to end test, (does the site load page x)
* You DONT NEED all this complexity, you can deploy a site with HTML and CSS.
