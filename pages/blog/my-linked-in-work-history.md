My linked in work history is empty.  I made up a position about content
developer that tracks how long I've been blogging.  I think i did this because
LinkedIn requires it.  Either way this is public knowledge and fine sharing.

## Social Engineering

If you have taken any security class for your job seriously you have already
been told not to share your work with most companies to the public, this is
private information that only opens you up for social engineering attacks
against that company.

## I care about privacy and security

I care about the security of these companies I work for and their reputation,
so I refuse to publically share it.
