`jq` has some syntax that will sneak up on you with complexity. It looks so good,
and so understandable, but everytime I go to use it myself, I don't get it.
`ijq` is an interactive alternative to `jq` that gives you and nice repl that you
can iterate on queries quickly.

```bash
paru -Syu ijq
```

Here are some other articles, I decided to link at the time of writing this article.
