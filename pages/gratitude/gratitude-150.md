Today feels sad, it just does.  The politics of this stupid pandemic
just hurt.  Its really amplifying a lot of things that have been there
for years and it hurts.

Wyatt and I played a vehicle mod for Minecraft today, It was super fun,
we ended up making a boat course where we made big jumps with different
water elements.  He was definitely the better boat operator.  I would
spot where he was landing and making landings in those place.
