### Wyatt Graduated OT

This week Wyatt hit a milestone. He graduated from his OT therapy!! ðŸŽ‰**ðŸŽ‰** He has come such a long way since our first visit with them. He now has many techniques to help him calm himself down. He is now able to recognize hist different moods very well and what to do in each of them to get to a more stable one or stay where he is. I just wanted to take a minute to mentally reflect on this journey with myself, and how exciting it is to see him doing so well today.
