![[https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/til-2025-09-env-files-with-uv-run]]

I smell a dependency to `python-dotenv` dying in my workflow.  I originally read the title of the post and thought, "I know how to manage .env and almost skipped it".  I'm leaning more and more on `uv run` these days, so this should [[ just ]] go in my [[ just file ]] to make it easy to run.
