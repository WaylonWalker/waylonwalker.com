Aws went down today and it sent waves of panic through the world as we realize
how much we have centralized on just a few points of failure for critical
services like airlines.  I'm grateful that it's back up and did not leave
people stranded for days like the cloud strike failure last year.  I'm grateful
for as much chaos it caused at work that there was not anything directly in my
  line of fire.
