I am so grateful that even during a rough time, a time where I feel that I struggle to get things accomplished.  I feel that I dont put the time in, people recognize me for my work.  There are days that I feel that I cannot get the simplest of thing to work, and wonder what am I doing here, I feel like I dont know how to do what I need to, someone pops in to say thanks for my work for them.  Sometimes I feel that I stretch myself too broad and I do too many different types of things to get good at any of them.  Then someone comes my way to ask me how to do it because they know I am one of the few in our area that knows the full spectrum from end to end.  These gentle reminders keep me going.  They remind me that I can do it.  They remind me that no everyone knows what they are doing 100% of the time.  They remind me where I was, and where I am.  They remind me of the progress that I have already made.  They remind me that my goals are always changing and moving, but along the way I have reached so many.  So today, tell someone about the great work that they did, and how it helped you.  Tell them that you have confidence in their work and their hard work is appreciated.
