I am risk-adverse.  I want everything well thought out and calculated before I
make any sort of change.  I have never gambled in my life and just the thought
of it makes me anxious.

## Aim it

I can use this as a strength to plan out potential issues and prevent them.  I
do this quite often with my role in infrastructure.  

I need to make sure that I use deadlines to keep this as a strength and not
hinderence.

## Automation

One of the biggest ways that I utilize this skill is automation.  I am all
about automating things, not just because I don't want to do the manual work,
but I am not sure when I am going to need to do something again.
