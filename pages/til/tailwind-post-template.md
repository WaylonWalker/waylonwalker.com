Today I am playing around with tailwind, flexing the css muscle and learning
how to build new and different layouts with it.

I created a new post template that mimics a terminal look in css where I could
inject the post title, description, and other frontmatter elements.

<iframe src='/playground/tailwind-post-template' width='100%' height='800px' class='overflow-hidden' scrolling='no'/>

I think this is a pretty cool layout, I could make a carbon.sh clone or more
realistically I could make it into a template for blog pages and this could
become og images.
