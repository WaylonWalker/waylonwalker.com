title: Strip Trailing Whitespace from Git projects

A common linting error thrown by various linters is for trailing whitespace.  I
most often use flake8.  I generally have
[pre-commit]([https://waylonwalker.com/pre-commit-is-awesome](https://waylonwalker.com/pre-commit-is-awesome/)
hooks setup to strip this,
but sometimes I run into situations where I jump into a project without it, and
my editor lights up with errors.  A simple fix is to run this one-liner.

## One-Liner to strip whitespace

_<small><mark>bash</mark></small>_
``` bash
git grep -I --name-only -z -e '' | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/[ \t]\+\(\r\?\)$/\1/'
```
