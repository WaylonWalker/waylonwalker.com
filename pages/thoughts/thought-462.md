Dax talked about this in a recent How about tomorrow podcast https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/461.  He is using it as his dev machine, he just ssh's in and devs on it.  Feels like quite an interesting workflow, their prices seem competitive, but as a cheap ass homelabber I see their prices and think I could grab a used optiplex for the cost of a month or two of these and probably wouldn't know the difference.  DAX mentions longer compile times so maybe he does notice.
