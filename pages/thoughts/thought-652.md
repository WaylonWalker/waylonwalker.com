linkarzu has a way to navigate his entire mac using a hyper key.  Everything looks so tight and polished, also a lot to remember!  Lucky he has a system of mnemonics that make it easy to remember.  His setup is very Mac focused using mac only apps, so this would not work for me, though I'm sure I could get something similar on linux.  He did mention Kanata which is cross platform.

## What I do

I use a far different system that is fast loose and easy.  On every system I run I have 9 workspaces that let me put 9 applications, I can easily move apps to different workspaces and have a side by side if I need.  The core of what I do is terminal, web browser, and chat. Those go on workspaces 4,5,6, whch are home-row keys.  If I'm running obs, that is on 8, steam goes on 1. but I have some freedom to move.  Sometimes 2 will be an image editor or a video editor, sometimes something else all together, but I can quickly go to each app.

## What I like from Linkazru

I do like his layered approach.  I run a 42 key keyboard so things can get a bit cramped quickly. And when thinking in mnemonics you only get 26 letters in the alphabet, but prefixing these with another layer this number goes up exponentially.  Sublayers sound sick to be honest.
