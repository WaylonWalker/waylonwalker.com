> Litestar is an interesting api framework similar to fastpi, that I am interested to check out to see if it fits into some project scope.  It sounds like it comes with a lot more batteries included for things like auth, but does not have hard opinions like django.  At this point I'm not jumping off of fastapi, but its something I want to try.
