> Atuin desktop sounds dope AF, tried to install it off the AUR and it was broken for me.  Seems early and the dev team is all in on mac.  They have an official .deb and .rpm.  I'll have to try again later, maybe the binary will work.

The idea of building out runbooks from my Atuin data sounds dope AF.  It sounds like a mix of markdown and executable cells like a jupyter notebook, but not.  Really pitching hard to those of us in the system administration, dev ops, SRE space.  Having something that you walk through when a system goes down and you are feeling panicked in DR mode sounds relieving.
