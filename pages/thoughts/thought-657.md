> [this post](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/playing-with-blog-home/) by Jim Nielsen, lead me to [this commit](https://github.com/jimniels/blog/commit/b1a250b2357d21e69a58ce3265114e1761fb47f8) where I found that he was including posts of his that wound up on hackernews.  I really like this idea and might take it, even though i have very few HN linked posts.
