### My own Pace

Last night Wyatt was up in the night and was often coming in to ask for things.
This often calls for a rough day. On this day though, he crashed about 8:00
and took a big nap. This gave me time to get up and out of bed At my own pace.
I make my own coffee, listened to my own music, and was able to work one my own
website! It is very relaxing to just do your own thing for a moment every once
in awhile. Without my family life would be very boring. I am grateful for
every one of them, but sometimes living at my own pace is very relaxing.

> I totally guessed at this date
