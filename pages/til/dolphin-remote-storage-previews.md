I've got a few samba shares going in my homelab, and I'm struggling finding a
great app to scroll through vacation photos with my wife.  I want something
intuitive, non intimidating, and just works.  Turns out that the default file
browser application for hyprland works great, but you need to enable previews
for remote storage for it to work for my use case here.
