Supercross is back.  Rhiannon and I took a few years off from watching
supercross, the first time I had since I was probably 15 or so.  I am
not sure what happened mentally, but we had a bad experience while going
to one live and just kinda stopped watching for a few years, but now we
are back and it made for a fun date night night in.  I am so glad to
have her with me and just as excited to get back into it as I am.
