👏👏👏preach it prime!  M$ continues to prove that they are not making products for you something else is affoot and shit you don't want is shoved down your throat and forced on you.

Prime points out that the agentic is prompt injected itself😂.  Rather than making a better os experience it's assuming you are stupid and need everything done for you.  But what I don't get here in the text scaling example.  Why the F does it not just fix it for me.  When I ask the machine to make text bigger it puts a flashy circle where to click.  This is a one time setup for someone who gives no fucks to remember how to do it.  Why is the machine doing this weird hand holding watching us do it's work rather than just doing it? I like the pattern when you change display setting it gives you a counter that reverts everything if for some reason shit is so bad you can't even see it.  Do that, not this help me click bs.

Now in parallel we have steam making Linux desktop better and better.  Allowing you to just access the hardware you own to do what you want to do with it.  Providing a fantastic hands off out of the box experience for the price of the hardware.  No ongoing fees, no upgrade cycle, soft lock, aribraray cutoff date, tpm bs requirements.  Good stuff as it was supposed to be created.
