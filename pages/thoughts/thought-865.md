Microsoft has been addding features to Minecraft for over 10 years now.  Idk if there was momentum from the mojang theme, but we've barely paid attention to any updates in the last five years.  The ocean update was huge, caves and cliffs were huge then it trailed off to we play each release on release day, use commands to try out new features, then never touch them again either to play minecraft as we always have or to play a modded pack with crazy new features that really make an impact on gameplay.
