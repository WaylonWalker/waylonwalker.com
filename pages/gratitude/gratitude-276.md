Chill day, nothing pressing that needs done in a rush.  Started cleaning up my
office and desk after a long period of projects and inability to do it.  It's
got a long ways to go, but already feels so much nicer in here.  Made more
progress in SilkSong with Wyatt,  I had to help him past Sister Splinter, which
unlocks a whole set of new areas in the map with wall jump.

Just dropped my first post in a little while, feels good to document progress
on some things like [[ 3d-printing-dovetails-experiment ]].
