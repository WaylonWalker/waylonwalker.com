Vim has a handy feature to format text with `gq`.  You can use it in visual
mode, give it a motion, or if you give it `gqq` it will format the current line.
I use this quite often while writing in markdown, I do not use softwraps in vim,
so `gqq` quickly formats my current line into a paragraph.    Once I have done
this for a single line one time I typically switch to the motion for around
paragraph `gqap` to format the whole paragraph and not just the current line.
