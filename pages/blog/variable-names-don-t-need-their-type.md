title: Variables names don't need their type

So often I see a variables `type()` inside of its name and it hurts me a little
inside.  Tell me I'm right or prove me wrong below.

## Examples

Pandas `DataFrames` are probably the worst offender that I see

``` python
# bad
sales_df = get_sales()

# good
sales = get_sales()
```

Sometimes vanilla structures too!

``` python
# bad
items_list = ['sneakers', 'pencils', 'paper', ]

# good
items = ['sneakers', 'pencils', 'paper', ]
```

## Edge Cases?

It's so common when you need to get inside a data structure in a special way that itsn't provided by the library.... I am not exactly sure of a good way around it.

``` python
# bad ??
sales = get_sales()
sales_dict = sales.to_dict()

# good
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
```

## Containers are plural

Always name your containers plural, so that naming while iterating is simple.

``` python
prices = {}
items = ['sneakers', 'pencils', 'paper', ]
for item in items:
   prices[item] = get_price(item)
```

Before I start fights ü•ä in code review, am I inline here or just being pedantic?
