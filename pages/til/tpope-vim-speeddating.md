Today I discovered [vim-speeddating](https://github.com/tpope/vim-speeddating)
by tpope.  I'm sure I've seen years ago but it did not click for my workflow
until today.  I often go through pictures from my phone for the past few days
and make [[shots]] posts, but I want to date them to about when the image was
taken most of the time.  This allows me to quickly bump days up and down using
`c-a` and `c-x` even around the new year.
