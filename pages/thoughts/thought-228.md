> Great episode covering a seemingly simple topic.  What I really benefitted from was hearing all the different use cases, from logging, debugging, to a/b testing, caching, and auth.  I hadn't even thought of it being applied to a router.  I thought of it being applied for an entire application.  This seems very useful for things like an admin router, all routes would need to have the admin role to get in.
