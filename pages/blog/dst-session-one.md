Wyatt is also documenting his run, while we aren't playing in the same world we
are playing together.

## Loading into the world

I always select the character _Woodie_.  He comes with an axe called _Lucy_ she
has some dark humor (but not too dark), I like her.  She also does not wear out
so you always have a weapon and way to chop wood with you.

## First encounter with a Tall Bird

On the first day I made a look around my home biome, and ran into a Tall Bird

## Setting up base

Just after the first night started I found my way back to the center of the map
and made a stone campfire.  I really like to use the stone campfires as they
last forever, you just have to add wood.  I was lucky enough to find stone by
the Tall Bird to make this one on first day.

## Opening up the garden

On day two I had enough materials gathered to make the garden digamajig to prep
the soil for gardening.  I planted the few seeds that I stole from the birds
right away.

## Getting a hat

I had the grass for a hat, so I figured why not.  I'm not sure if  it really
helps this time of year, but I thought it looked good on Woodie.

## Getting into it with a Clockwork Bishop

As I was gathering resources with Lucy, minding my own business **BAM** I got
hit with an attack from a Clockwork Bishop, man these things hit hard and have
really good aim.  I took three hits before getting away, leaving me with very
low heath at the end of this play session.
