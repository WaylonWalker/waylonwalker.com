Today was good, the cough is going away, the energy is coming back, but the
afternoon crash is still there pretty hard.  Overall good end to the week, had
an outage right at the end of the day, I have a feeling another patch out of
my control killed me.  But I'm grateful that I saw it quick on the status page
and was able to recover before any reports.  Tonight we had biscuits and gravy
it was so good, played Uno with Ayla and Fingerboarding with Wyatt.
