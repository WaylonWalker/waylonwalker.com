Not surprising theirs a lag, between the models getting better, the tools getting better, and the masses getting better at using them, it takes time.  This is still quite a hockey stick.  I'm wondering how many are not posting on Show HN embarrassed they built something they know nothing about and afraid to get questions.  I have no idea how anyone would get this ratio, but if I were a betting man, Id bet the ratio of build/show went way up.  Plus we are probably getting a ton of people who have never heard of HN start building cool bespoke things for themselves and thats it, they use it, they love it, they might tell/show a friend.
