#### Reputation


Today I am very proud of the reputation that I have buit.  I am very well respected inside my community.  My opinions are valued.  I am known to be very reliable.  I will deliver what I have promised on time, or give plenty heads up that it's not going to happen.  I work in an organization that is very closed doors.  Folks keep their knowledge to themselves, and are generally not willing to help others accross the organization without a kick back.  I give out all of my best knowledge for free, and will at lease give anyone a few mintutes of time to point them in the right direction. I am really proud of where this has lead me, and the reputation I have gained.
