A side effect of [[ markata-didyoumean ]] is that we are able to implement some
rudimentary search based on slug, title, tags, and description.

I made a video of the early work on using this side effect to search for content on markata.dev.

This was first implemented to solve 404 pages giving users a way to try to find
the page that they tried to access.  But it turned out to be a decent way to
search through the docs.
