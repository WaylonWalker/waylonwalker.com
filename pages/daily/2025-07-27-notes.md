## archlinux BTW devtainer

Made some progress on moving my devtainer back from ubuntu to arch, it's
somewhat pertinent because a few of the things I use are now outdated and I
just want to use a package manager and not have to build things from scratch.

## Kubernetes Development Environment

I also setup a dev environment in kubernetes, already using this new arch
image, its great so far, writing this post from it.

As a challenge how much of my workflow could be done from kubernetes, docker
build, and run would be hard, but I bet I could come up with something.  The
clipboard part of my workflow would need a major change, especially for
grabbing previous terminal outputs.
