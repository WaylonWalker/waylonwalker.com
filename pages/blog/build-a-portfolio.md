Follow this over time.  If you want to use code repositories for your portfolio.
Make sure that you have made it unique in some way.  Think about what kind of
signal you are sending to hiring managers if you are linking to a project with
no docs, and one commit from 3 days ago.

They don't have to be PERFECT either, it's likely that it's not something you
were paid to do, hence not able to put your full time into. Just having
something that generally follows some GOOD practice will set you above most
other candidates.

Make sure that it reflects you as a person.  The worst that can happen is for
you to hire in based on some false pretense and hate where you end up.
