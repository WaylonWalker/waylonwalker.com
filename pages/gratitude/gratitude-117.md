What a DAY, the landlord reached out to us last minute asking if he
could show the house we are renting to potential buyers tomorrow, giving
us only one days notice!  It was a bit chaotic, a lot of emotions around
letting someone in our house, especially while the biggest wave of COVID
is in full force.

I am so gratefult that we can do all the things that we need without
much need of bringing anyone into our house.  I am so glad this house
has been reliable for use and not needed much maintenance.  For the most
part our groceries are delivered to us, or for a short period was
gathered for us and we picked it up.

It's just so nervewracking letting people in right now.  I am just
asking for everyone to be ok.  Most people can handle this just fine,
but Rhiannon's lungs are barely hanging in there with her current
illness as is, there is no way she could get through without a least a
rough hospital stay.
