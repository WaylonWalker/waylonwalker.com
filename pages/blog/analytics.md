I've been posting on this site since 2016, when there was a huge rollout of
layoffs at the company I was working at at the time.  In fear of being laid off
personal blog and side projects was at the top of the suggestions so off I
I started looking at what I needed to do to start building my resume, having a
went. This site is built on [[ markata ]], more about that in the [[ colophon ]].

## Post Contributions in 2023

2023 was a very busy year for me and I started slowing down.  About mid year I
felt like I had a lot that I wanted to get out, but felt like I couldn't,
because I did not have the time to blog, so I added [[ thoughts ]] on 7/22/2023
with this [first thought](https://waylonwalker.com/thoughts-2/).

## Post Contributions in 2021

At the End of 2021 I started posting [[ til ]]s daily for a few months.  This
is the point when I really started lowering the barrier to entry to make a blog
post.  A blog post did not need to be a super long essay, but could be the size
of a tweet.

## Post Contributions in 2019

2019 was a huge learning year for me.  I was very busy leading a migration to
the cloud, containerized data pipeline orchestration, and setting up new
projects and templates using [[ kedro ]]

## Post Contributions in 2018

This was the year I really started reaching for the terminal kicking off the
year with [[vim-notes]] and rounding out with [[bash]].  I had been
watching luke smith for a awhile, and started managing my first linux server at
work.  I was stuck with windows at the time, but wsl was a new thing that let
me run linux in the terminal.

## Post Contributions in 2017

2017 was the year of getting started, I was coming up on 5 years into my
career, and layoffs were happening hard at the time.  I remember fist landing 5
years before and being told in the companies long history they have never laid
off engineers, it was a very safe place to be.  This was a wake up call that it
might all turn around and I would take nothing with me.  Blogging became my way
to document things I was learning, it was making be better at communicating,
and giving me a reason to take a deeper dive into interesting topics.

## Post Contributions in 2016

2016 was the year that I created my github account, and really got serious
about career switching from Mechanical Engineering to Software Engineering.
All of my 2016 posts are back-dated github stars.
