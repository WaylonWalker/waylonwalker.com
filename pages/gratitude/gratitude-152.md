We bought out house today!!  This all happened so fast and has been such
a mix of emotions all the way.  I am just so happy to be able to provide
my family with a house they can love and cherish and grow up in.  We
woke up today thinking that it was going to be at lease four more days
as we were waiting on the irs, but due to some Mortgage company magic we
were able to close today!
