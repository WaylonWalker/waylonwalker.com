> Cloud is cooked bois.  Seriously too much dumb shit relies on the cloud.  Too much critical shit relies on single AZ's.  If normies are literally loosing sleep over an AWS outage (queue the Uncle Roger Voice), You've Fucked up.  It's wild to even think about a bed relying on the cloud let alone fully stop working when UE-1 goes down.  I want to live in a world of opt in FEATURES, things that bring value to a product because it makes it better.  Somehow a bed smells suspiciously like a cash grab for a subscription because its cloud connected.  And yet for some reason it takes 16GeeeBee's per month.  I don't own one of these, and I don't want to.  I don't want a subscription for everything, I want my shit to just work.  The future we are headed towards a world that is ever more reliant on a few key clouds.  Which is fine.  It's fantastic that small companies can start and scale without owning an infrastructure team.  It's great that they have the ability to give us many nines of reliability.  Some things just don't need the cloud.
