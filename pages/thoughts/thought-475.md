Atuin v18.4 is out with an atuin wrapped command.


Here's Ellie's Wrapped.

This is a pretty sick command, I've only been using Atuin about as long as I've been on bazzite, so maybe 4 months, but here is my wrapped.

Comparing to Ellie, I'm surprised that I even have 126 package related commands, being on an immutable distro most of my packages come from the container, I don't need to run packaging commands.  My cd is also super low, I use tmux sessions to take me where I need to be most of the time, which is a project's root directory, It's pretty rare to see me outside of a project root directory.

I'd venture to guess that nvim would be higher if it didn't auto start on every tmux session as well.
