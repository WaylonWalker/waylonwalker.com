Vacation coming to an end we woke up early to the sound of thunder rolling into
the area as we started to load the van with all of our belongings.  What
incredible timing, while it started out as a heat wave, we were still able to
hit the lake for activities.  The weather held out till the last moment that we
had our airbnb.  I cannot be more grateful for how this turned out.  It turned
into a bit of a stressful ride home very focused on every moment of the wheels,
sensing the water taking us a bit adrift.  Watching out for other vehicles in
the low visibility.  Only missing one turn while trying to pay more attention
to the road and only following the lane number shown on the GPS.

The rain had let up by this point, but I grabbed a quick shot of the gutter
fulls of rain coming off the gas station while we filled up.

We made it home unpacked, and got our pets, they were so happy to see us again.
