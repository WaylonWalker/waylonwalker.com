> Salesforce gets pwnd by the ai hype bros and killed its reputation with employees, letting them know where they truely stand with them.  4k people sounds like a lot, its probably a big chunk of savings, but was it worth the loss of reputation?  There must be a better way to give this a trial run that lets them understand this before disrupting the lives of real people right???
