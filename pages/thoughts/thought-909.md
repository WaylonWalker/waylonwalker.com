> > The answer is I do it habitually. If there's a big enough idea I've had floating around in my head and I think others might find it useful / interesting then I usually think it's worth logging it somewhere. If I don't, I'll likely just keep thinking about it so might as well get it out of my head and on the internet where people can find it.

This is how you do it.  If you want to do something, you need to make it a habit. Something you crave, something you need.  I need to write my ideas down in this blog, it helps me index ideas for later, but more importantly it helps me flesh them out and think through real things.

Congrats on 1k, your site is awesome [Hammy](https://hammy.xyz)
