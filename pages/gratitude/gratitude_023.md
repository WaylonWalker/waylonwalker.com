#### Excitement

This year I started a new position at work.  Everything about it is enjoyable.  Not sure if that is jut the honeymoon phase or not.  I am working as a data scientist.  Its exciting that there is so much low hanging fruit to be had.  In my previous role as an engineer I was in a very established role.  While this role was great,  I really enjoyed it, and had no intentions of moving until  this oppotunity landed in my lap.  I felt like being in such an establishd role the job was to follow the processes that had been previously set up.  Now being in a much less established role there is a lot more room for creativity.  I like getting to work and really being excited to get to work creating things that add value to the organization.
