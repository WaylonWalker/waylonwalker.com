Go is feeling more and more like something I could throw in my tool belt as a python dev.  I really like that it's garbage collected and has great error management.  I am just not sure how to work it in without it being the main thing.  The thing that is so cool is the ability to ship tiny pre-compiled binaries that just work, and the raw speed.  these binaries just get up and working without any warm up.  writing any cli in python I'm going to be using something like typer, and it takes half a second just to warm up, so even hello world cannot be faster than half a second.
