Just tried using my twitter api key for the first time in quite awhile.  Apps now need to be tied to projects in order to work.  It looks like projects are where pricing comes into play.  Thankfully they still give a free tier for doing small time things for myself.  You can really see the effect that llms have on these things though as it is 5x more expensive to read posts than to make posts currently.  Data is the new gold for these kind of companies.
