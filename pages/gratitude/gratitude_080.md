#### Fun

This morning Wyatt had a 2 hr delay.  I still took Ayla to school on time.  I did some work, but still had some time for fun on the MineCraft server.  This is a new world that Wyatt named Nathan.  We did a 20 minute mining session, and at the end wyatt found the first diamonds of the server.  He was in a really fun mood, and we were chatting it up the whole time, working together towards a common goal.  He was so cooperative, taking on tasks of his own, giving me tasks, divying up materials along the way to make sure each could accomplish their task.
