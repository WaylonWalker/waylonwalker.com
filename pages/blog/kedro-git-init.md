Immediately after `kedro new`, before you start running `kedro install` or your first line of code the first
thing you should always do after getting a new kedro template created is to
`git init`.

##  git init

Its as simple as these three commands to get started.

``` bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m init
```

I don't care if this project is for learning, if it will never have a remote or not, use git.
