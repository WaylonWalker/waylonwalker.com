Last night we cleaned up the garage workbench and started painting some set signs that are the size of a full size bed, nearly 4'x8'.  Wyatt started painting his fingerboard park set black, he is going for a black and white set.

Here is a bigger park setup we were working on before we had to clean up for sanding and painting.  Trying to set up a stairset on each end with a pyramid in the middle.
