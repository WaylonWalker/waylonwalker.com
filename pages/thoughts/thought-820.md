Forgejo supports repository mirrors, I think this is how I am going to handle migrating all of my github repos into forgejo.  over time I'll probably go through and delete a bunch of unnecessary one from github, ones that might have a user or two I might keep on github.  I have such small scale projects with almost no users I am not sure that It really matters for me or not.
