> This commit to my keymap gets rid of vertical combos, those were a bad idea to me.  Maybe I didnt give it a shot, but hitting two keys at once on purpose with the same finger is a skill, one that I don't have.  This change maps those symbols so that they work as a combo or layer switch, so getting the layer key in first does it by layer, but pressing them at the same time gives me the combo, kinda feels genius.  We will see how it goes.
