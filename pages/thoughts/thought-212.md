Underrated python library to on board ruff, or just use it on a project where its not the norm.  ruff claims that its 99.9% compatible with black and when you read through the known differences they are clearly edge case bugs in black.

> See this page for more about the comparison to black https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruffs-formatter-compare-to-black

oh and I just noticed that it is maintianed by Charlie, and comes straight out of astral.
