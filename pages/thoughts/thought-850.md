> The Year of the Linux Desktop is a meme, every year is the year of the Linux desktop as it gains rounding errors of market share.  Outside of Linux nerds, developers that use servers on the regular, cheap asses reviving old hardware that is dead in the eyes of other OS's, the average user wont even notice a difference with the right distro.  I ran bazzite with plasma for over a year, It would be super beginner friendly while allowing users customization on levels never seen on non-Linux machines.  Other than adobe, roblox, and EA games with easy anti-cheat most users probably aren't going to run in to any issues.  They probably wont even notice at this point, which is where the meme comes in.  Why would anyone switch if its not noticeably different for the average user, they wont, until what is working for them stops working for them.
