This is a pretty sweet interface into llms.  I used it a bit with my son tonight while he was asking me for datapack ideas.

``` bash
❯ mods -f 'I am trying to have fun on my minecraft server and am creating a minecraft datapack send me some load.mcfuncions that will make it fun'
```

You can continue the conversation with a `-C`

``` bash
❯ mods -C -f 'I like where you are going with number 4, can you make it so that it runs when a player opens a door'
```

```
