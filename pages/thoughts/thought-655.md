> > Maybe we need a little more friction in the world. More things that merit our time. Less things that don’t.

I can resonate with this post, less friction feels like it leads me to thinking less, having less skin in the game, understanding less, feeling less fulfilled.  Vibe coding is a new trend of 2025, it feels like the future, but it does not quite feel like the present yet.  It's riddled with errors and I only get frustrated when it doesn't work.  I like having some friction that leads me to think and pay attention.  There might be a future where this is not required for some things like coding up crud apps, but that does not feel like today.
