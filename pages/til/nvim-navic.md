With the latest release of version of nvim 0.8.0 we get access to a new winbar
feature.  One thing I have long wanted somewhere in my nvim is navigation for
pairing partners or anyone watching can keep track of where I am.  As the
driver it's easy to keep track of the file/function you are in.  But when you
make big jumps in a few keystrokes it can be quite disorienting to anyone
watching, and having this feedback to look at is very helpful.

## winbar

nvim exposes the winbar api in lua, and you can send any text to the winbar as follows.

``` lua
vim.o.winbar = "here"
```

You can try it for yourself right from the nvim command line.

``` vim
:lua vim.o.winbar = "here"
```

Now you will notice one line above your file with the word `here` at the very
beginning.

## Clearing the winbar

If you want to clear it out, you can just set it to an empty string or `nil`.

``` vim
:lua vim.o.winbar = ""
:lua vim.o.winbar = nil
```

## Setting up nvim-navic

You will need to install `nvim-navic` if you want to use it.  I added it to my
plugins using Plug as follows.

``` vim
call plug#begin('~/.local/share/nvim/plugged')
Plug 'SmiteshP/nvim-navic'
call plug#end()
```

I created an `on_attach` function long ago, cause that's what Teej told me to
do.  Now I am glad I did, because it made this change super easy.

``` lua
local function on_attach(client, bufnr)
    if client.server_capabilities.documentSymbolProvider then
        navic.attach(client, bufnr)
    end
end
```

Then you need to use that `on_attach` function on all of the lsp's that you
want navic to work on.

Then in a lua file you need to setup the winbar, for now I put this in my
lsp-config settings file, but eventually I want to move my settings to lua and
put it there.

``` lua
vim.o.winbar = " %{%v:lua.vim.fn.expand('%F')%}  %{%v:lua.require'nvim-navic'.get_location()%}"
```

## What my winbar looks like

What I have right now is everything someone who is watching would need to know
to navigate to the same place that I am in the project.

``` text
 waylonwalker/app.py   Link >  on_click
```

## Diff

Here are the changes that I made to to my plugins list and my lsp-config to get
it.
