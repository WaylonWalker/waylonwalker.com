> Such a good interview @lexfridman is such a talented interview.  It's so cool to see the other side of this.  For weeks we've heard about the story of the name change, we've seen everyone shitting on the security model, buying up all the mac minis in existance, fear mongering not to install this thing.  @steipete.me has such a cool story from the beginning talking about making this thing fun and exciting.  Giving it a personality that is not "You are absolutely right".  The story of changing the name twice, and getting pwnd on every step the first time and nailing it the second time is incredible.  Dude is having fun trying to make the thing he wants in the world exist.
