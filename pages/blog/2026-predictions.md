I'm late on this one so I've seen everyone else's.  I'll try my best to make
some bold predictions I've not seen elsewhere 


## more open source, less open contribution

I predict that this is the point in time that we see an explosion of open
source, but more projects than ever going the way of sqlite, Livestream,
android, unreal engine, aesprite.  It is getting so easy for agents to generate
10k lines of code in a few hours.  This makes it easy for folks who have ideas
they want to create to create them.  It also makes it much harder to accept
outside contributions when they make such massive changes.  Thirdly it be
easier for folks to just make their own fork to do what they want.

Right now it's hard to name 5 big open source, closed contribution projects by
the end of the year there will be 5 more that are recognizable.

I think more open contribution will go the way of [[ whenwords ]], spec driven
development.  This is very high level.  Very easy to understand a large portion
of the codebase very quickly.  Very easy for anyone to understand.  While it's
all written in plain English and not code it has a way of being deterministic,
and does not skip on software engineering principles.  

## 2026 is not the year to build hardware

The time will come hardware will be cheap.  I hold a lot of hope for this, but
2026 is not that year.  This really isn't my area of expertise what do I know
other than I have gaming PCs, laptops steam decks, and servers in my house.  I
predict none of them get an upgrade with new parts this year, but there will be
a year in the future that upgrades are so cheap that it's hard to pass on.
Sites like serverpartdeals will be flooded with good drives from failed data
center plans (so many in place right now not all of these companies will
survive, not predicting any mass bubble pop here, that's above my pay grade).
But 2026 is not that year.

## Agents will overwork us

There is going to be burnout this year, people are going to be running point on
12 agents for most of their day and be plain ass burnt out by the end of the
year.  This shit feels different and its hard to see right now.  Most of us can
feel programming work, the stress it brings, the joy it brings.  We have a
decent sense of being almost there, just 10 more minutes to wrap up.  It's
taken us a long time to hone this craft.  We don't have a sense for an agent
almost being there.  The work we put into planning for agents feels different.
It doesn't _feel_ as hard, but it engages a higher level of thinking that
allows us to see the forest for the trees.  It can let us work on more things
at the same time.  I predict by the end of the year there will be podcast
episodes talking about burnout, and specifically feeling burnt out on planning
for agents work.

## 2026 is to ai as 2012 was for js frameworks
