> This is an absolute banger of a review by prime and Dylan Beetle.  I love the similar takes with different perspectives, would really like to see them podcast together, but this one way style interview does really well to cover a lot of issues in open source, rug pulls, version pinning, thankless maintainers, what its like to open source from a large company.
