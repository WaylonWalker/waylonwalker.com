Just starred [markata-todoui](https://github.com/WaylonWalker/markata-todoui) by [WaylonWalker](https://github.com/WaylonWalker). It's an exciting project with a lot to offer.

A todo plugin for markata.  It is a tui (text user interface) that runs in the terminal using textual.  It gives me a trello-board feel from the terminal.  I can create, update, delete, move, and fully manage my todo items from the terminal with it.
