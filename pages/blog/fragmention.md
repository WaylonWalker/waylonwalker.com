This post is still WIP. .....

<https://indieweb.org/fragmention##Challenges>

I've been digging through David Bushell's blog over the past day, he has some
really good ideas about blogging and webdev.  One really interesting post I
came accross is
[url-fragment-text-directives](https://dbushell.com/2024/12/05/url-fragment-text-directives/).
I've long had id's linked on my headings, though sometimes broken, or now
showing the link, I've done my best to include them.  Fragmentions extend this
to allow any text to be linkable like this.
