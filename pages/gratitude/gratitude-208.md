I don't mean to have two trampoline related posts in a row, but today I am so
proud of Ayla, she landed a trick that she has been working towards for months.
It's impressive to watch her learn and grow with something more athletic like
this.  Her joints hold her back from a lot of things, so it really is hard for
her.  She is generally much more timid and reserved than kids of her age on
something like the trampoline and afraid of hurting herself.  She takes things
very slow and only goes for something when shes got it.

Glad to have Rhiannon back home today, she left for two days to see her new
nephew.  The kids were fantastic without her here, but I can tell they were
holding a bit more back with her gone, probably bottling up a little bit.  They
do so good when we are down one, but somehow expect 4x when the both of us are
here.
