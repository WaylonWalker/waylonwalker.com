Today I'm going through resume's looking for a replacement for someone on my team that got hit with RTO mandate, unable to comply without major changes to his family, his life, his well-being.  It's a hard process to go through.  It's really eye opening right now just how much slop is out there.  I don't blame these people, competition is fierce trying to find a job, and if you are not the one submitting 100s of resumes with AI someone else is.  It's really clear that a lot of these are AI written and many are suspiciously too close to exact wording that the Job Description has.  Anyways its hard to go through this, and not feel for those we have let go for reasons I don't agree with, its hard to look for a replacement for a REALLY GOOD engineer.  I'm grateful that things worked out for me and my family.  I'm grateful to have a job, a good one at that.  I'm grateful that I'm not the one on the market fighting for an interview.
