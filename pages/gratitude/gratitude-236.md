Happy Birthday America, today is a day spending time with family around home.
Not all that much different than normal but the neighborhood is buzzing with
activity, and the Neighbors always invite us over for a barbeque on all the
holidays.  I am so grateful for the community that we have around us, how
welcoming they are for our kids.
