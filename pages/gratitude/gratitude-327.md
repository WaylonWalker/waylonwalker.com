This morning was a slam bam appointment emergency filled morning requiring trips to school, setup and out the door, emails to school.  Things got a little hectic.  So grateful that I have the job I do, that I've put in the reps to set us up well, myself well to move fast and get things done.  So grateful for the grace I am allowed despite needing to go into the office.

This weekend we took a trip back to Iowa, just realizing that we really took no pictures while we were there.  Everything went so smooth, the kids had a fantastic time, family was all great and cooperative.  Wyatt went Ice fishing and caught 3 fish that he was able to cook with Papa right afterwards, so proud of him.
