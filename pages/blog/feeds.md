I have several feeds that you can consume my content with.  Many posts will
cross between them, so if you would like to follow a certain stream of content
in your rss reader thats what this is for.

## All

This is a feed of everything that I have published on my site to date.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/published)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/published/rss.xml)

## til

This is a feed of all of my TIL's (Today I Learned).  These are generally short
single topic posts that I write up quickly.  They are generally things that are
fairly new to me, often things that I struggled to find support for on the
internet, and felt that It needed yet one more article with my voice.

* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/til/rss.xml)

## Thoughts

These are generally my thoughts on a web page or some sort of url, except a
rare few don't have a link.  These are dual published off of my
[thoughts.waylonwalker.com](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com) site.  It's a
fully dynamically rendered site 2000's style.  Posts are stored in a database
and instantly available.  Almost all of the posts were written in a small
`<textarea>` field within a chrome extension that I built for it.

These posts are intended to in two ways.  One, link building for the author.  I
hope that I give the people helping me out along the way just a little bit of a
boost.  Two, they serve as a permanant commented bookmark for me to search, and
come back to later when I have forgotten where I have seen something.

## stars

I pull in all of my github stars into one feed [[ PESOS ]] style.

## Recent

This is a shorter version of **All**, as it is filtered down to only the posts
created within the last 30 days.

## Blog

These are my full big **B** **B**log posts.  They are what I started writing,
typically take a bit more time to put together.  I write fewer of them these
days than I used to.  I'd like to think that they are the more polished posts
of the bunch.

## Today

These are only the posts that went live the day that the site last built.  If
my scheduled builds keep working as intended they are today's posts.
