#### Breaks

Breaks are a good time for refresh and focus on some other things.  During this
holiday break I have been able to spend quite a bit of time with my beautiful
wife Rhiannon.  I have really enjoyed helping her setup her new adventure
cuttinscrap.com.  It will be a nice creative outlet for her
to combine her love of sewing and crafting with her love of speech and writing.
I am really excited to see her get going.

We have also spent some time at nights playing games and watching YouTube.  Its
really nice to not have to worry about anything work related and focus on the
family.  The extra time has helped strengthen our marriage and allow us to
discuss some things that have been on our minds for awhile.  Now its time to
start 2018 Fresh and Strong.
