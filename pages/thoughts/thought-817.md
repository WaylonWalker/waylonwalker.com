I'm playing through peak right now with Wyatt and it is a great game, a small wholesome  indiegame that is legit hard, but fun with the simplest concept.  You are a scout who has crashlanded on an island, your goal is to get to the peak with your friends.  You must manage hunger, stamina, weight, health and energy.  You have limited resources and must help everyone to the top, if someone is low on stamina, they are going to need a helping hand or a stonger climber to go up and set pitons and ropes.  Its a fantastic collaborative play game

> a short clip of me playing with wyatt, I did not have anything great to add, but this is just a random clip

## Ripped off

It was insta-ripped off by roblox with microtransactions pay to win garbage.  It looks one for one the same damn models and interface, they spared nothing at making it look exactly like the original.  They let you buy a golden apple assuming it gives you crazy stamina to climb with ease, and it costs goddam robux.  As Big A says here theres nothing they can really do, the roblox platform just lets this happen, and if they didn't they would loose huge revenue because this is so prevelant.  Legal fees would crush this small team that made it.
