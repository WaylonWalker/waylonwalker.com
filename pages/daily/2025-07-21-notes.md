In my adventure to rice out hyprland I set up a sddm theme today, and it looks
sick by only changing the wallpaper.  I tried out one theme and was pretty
happy with the results.

Alright, I ended up ricing out some more, looks so much better than the default sddm theme.

Default sddm.

My only hiccup was the wallpaper needed to be in a path relative to the theme
root directory and not an absolute path to my home directory.

This command was super helpful for testing greeter themes.

``` bash
sddm-greeter-qt6 --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/eucalyptus-drop
```
