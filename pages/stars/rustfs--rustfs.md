[rustfs](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs) by [rustfs](https://github.com/rustfs) is a game-changer in its space. Excited to see how it evolves.

🚀 RustFS is an open-source, S3-compatible high-performance object storage system supporting migration and coexistence with other S3-compatible platforms such as MinIO and Ceph.
