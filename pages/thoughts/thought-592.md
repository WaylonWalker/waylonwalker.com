> Davids blogs always have so many links that send me down new rabbit holes.  Interesting that his experience with smart home is turning away, I've been somewhat interested for awhile, but never fully pulled the trigger on buying things.

I really hope tailscale enshitification does not take off, but really for me, I barely use it even as a homelabber.  Idk why, but every other homelabber praises it so much and I just dont find myself using it.
