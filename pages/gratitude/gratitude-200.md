title: Gratitude 200

---

I've long neglected my gratitude journal, but here I am.  Today is a tough day
fighting for my rights to WFH.  I am so grateful that I have had the
opportunity to for so long, I'm able to be here with my family when it counts.
I am really greatful for my kickass home setup that is really a great place to
get a lot done in.  Its filled with good camera, mic, speakers, monitors,
keyboards, all so grateful to have the comfort of things I really enjoy using.
The thought of going back to a crowded, distracted office, sit at a chair I did
not pick, look at a monitor I did not pick, be given a membrane keyboard I will
toss in a drawer.  I'm remaining hopeful, I have a lot of personal issues that
I don't fully share here that play very heavy on my heart with this.
