> I really like the idea of Jim's Eternal Links, and really want to take it for myself.  To expand here I want to be able to look for common places for rss feeds, and be able to scrape out rss feeds for sites that I tend to link to often.  Also if they have something like a /blogroll it might be a good place to find new great people to follow.
