Not gonna lie, kinda pumped about this one.  I manually did one, jotted down the coordinates, opened the gcode in vim, added markers between setup/teardown and print. then added the wipe, the copy pasted the print+wipe section a bunch of times.

My printer tends to run a bit better on single prints than printing a dozen at once as it has less issues with retract start and stop.
