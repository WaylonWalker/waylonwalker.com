title: Gratitude 239

---

Today was a hard goddam day.  I am grateful that it did not turn out worse.  I
am grateful that changes endured will not have a large impact onto my family
and home life.  I am feeling very hurt by dumbass decisions that affect people
I care about, projects I care about, and will affect the outcome of projects
I'm involved in.  Things could be a lot worse.  I am trying to remain positive
and look for the good in things while I feel like I'm surrounded in dark
clouds.
