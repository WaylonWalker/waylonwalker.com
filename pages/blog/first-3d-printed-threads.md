Working on an upcoming project that requires some threaded screws.  Trying to
keep a low budget on this one with as much to come off of the printer as I can.
It might become a slant3d portals product if it works out.  I always like
making test prints for stuff like this especially to see how the feel is off of
the printer that is going to print the final product and take much longer.
First try was a success.
