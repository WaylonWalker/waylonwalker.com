####  Prep and Reflect

I have recently found a new podcast, The Ken Coleman Show, from the Ramsey network.  I really like Ken's style.  He recently talked about 2 two things that you should do everyday.  Prepare and reflect. If you are not doing these things it is very difficult to progress in your goals.  I really like how the gratitude journal works into the reflect piece of life.  It brings me positivity and a chance to look back on the day.  I like how I am able to reflect on the day, or last few days and find something positive that happened.  It also helps me think about how I can improve myself.  I am  also reflecting throughout the day as I think about things that I might write about in the journal.
