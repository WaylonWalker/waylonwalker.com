#### Initial post

Thank You for getting up with me this morning. I really appreciate all of the
extra help. It means a lot to have my life partner there with me in the morning
helping with the kids.

#### Thank You

Those two words are very powerful. This morning when I was helping Rhiannon cut
her hair she looked at me and told me thank you very sincerely. It cut really
deep inside, and made me feel really good. I dont think I expressed my
gratitude for it very well as I had not yet had my coffee, and my response time
was a bit lacking. This is something that I would like to work on with my kids.
We really focus on our please's but, sometimes Thank Yous are forgotten, and we
are just happy that they are happy.

Overall I am most grateful today for the good morning that I have had with my
beautiful wife Rhiannon and our two kids, Ayla and Wyatt.
