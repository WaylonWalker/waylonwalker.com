THIS! is the same reasons that I built [thoughts](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com){.hoverlink}.  Simon has bee a big inspiration along the way.  He defintely changed the format of my posts as I watched him build out his quote posts.

> Link blogging is a pleasantly low-pressure way of writing online. Found something interesting? Post a link to it, with a sentence or two about why it's worth checking out.

Ditto! just make a post.

!!! note

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
