SNOW DAY!!!

Today was the first day of snow! The kids and I took full advantage.  We
scooped the driveway and sidewalk first so that it doesn't build up into
a sheet of ice since it never sees sun this time of year.  We built a
giant snow man at its tallest point it was taller than I could reach.
We went sledding down the hill by the trail.  Wyatt was the only one
that braved the trek all the way to the top.  I made sure that he didn't
hit the pile of logs at the bottom, but I was afraid I would have hit it
hard and hurt myself.  Ayla went pretty high up and had the biggest
smile on her face the hole time she was going down.
