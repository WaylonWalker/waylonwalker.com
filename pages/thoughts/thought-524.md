This man is responsible for making gaming on linux what it is today.  Such a heartfelt story to hear that reviving his dad's machine was at the core of what drove him to do what he has done for the wider gaming on linux community.  Update on your schedule, remove all the tracking and bloatware, this is what drove him to start using linux before making it accessible for his Dad.

> But really do update, this is not your 2002 PHP box, things need updated and regular updates help the process.
