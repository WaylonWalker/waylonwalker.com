> Gyroscope better than a mouse??  Nerd nest really sells how having two gyros in the way they have done for noise cancelling changes the game on it, and makes it a contender to replace a mouse.

It really makes me want to try it.  I love how repairable this controller looks.  I've got to imagine that the fact that it comes as a kit, and all the parts are available that this hits S tier repairability.  My current controller of choice is a PS5 and I've had stick issues I wish I could fix.

No analog triggers, I'm out.  Maybe they will make it an option in the future idk.  I don't play shooters where I need a hair trigger, this won't work on session or driving games.

micro usb, seriously, that kinda kills it for me too.  

**edit** I looked on their website and they have usb c in the latest version
