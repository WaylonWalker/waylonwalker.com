### My own Pace

Last night Wyatt was up in the night and was often coming in to ask for things.  This often calls for a rough day.  On this day though, he crashed about 8:00 and took a big nap.  This gave me time to get up and out of bed At my own pace.  I make my own coffee, listened to my own music, and was able to work one my own website!  It is very relaxing to just do your own thing for a moment every once in awhile.  Without my family life would be very boring.  I am grateful for every one of them, but sometimes living at my own pace is very relaxing.
