This afternoon Wyatt and I went on a big skate throught the
neighborhood.  He had such a good time he wanted to do a second lap, and
another later right at dark.  I am grateful that the sidewalks are so
nice for us to ride on wtih very few cracks that would fully take anyone
out. The traffic is also very mild.   There are very few cars on the
roads and the ones that are there are all going at a vy nice pace.  No
one really races through our neighborhood.
