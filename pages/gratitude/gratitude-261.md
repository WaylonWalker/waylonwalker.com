Big progress on file system and file shares today, I've tried a bunch of things
that left a messy trail behind, have fought file permissions between all of
them and I think I've landed on something simple that works and is getting
cleaned up very nice.  I'm grateful for the ability and to have the time to
invest in this it's going to make file sharing and backup much simpler and
better.  I'm grateful to have the hardware sitting in my basement to run it
all, the knowledge to do it, a friend group to help.  I'm happy to be able to
have all of my files in one place, see them on any device in the family from
anywhere.  I'm happy that I can put my mind at ease that the photos from any of
our phones will be able to be stored safely in our house with no fear if
loosing them.
