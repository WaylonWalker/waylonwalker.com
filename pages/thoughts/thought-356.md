> 50 minutes into this episode they start a discussion on seo, and naming posts.  They give Jerod the task of googling for tmux and see how high up the ranking they find Nick, expecting a number one post, and he cant even get to Nick.

The problem?  Jerod is such a beginner he doesn't even know what to search, he starts with a long query about getting started with tmux, but all of Nick's videos are why you should use advanced features of tmux, but Jerod has yet to discover that these exist.

As experts we often come up wtih a post title for the exact thing that we are trying to teach someone how to do, but yet, they haven't discussed that they need that feature yet, they just want the getting started guide, or tell me why I should start using tmux.  Not why sessions are better than windows, and tabs suck all together.

Definitely an eye opening conversation listening to two experts sit in shock as the beginner just gets dropped big tech articles, and Nick Jani-freakin-takis doesn't even hit the query page after page.

Also hats off to Nick for keeping a 2014 machine alive, I got you beat by a few years on my 2011 free give away machine, but I stopped daily driving that two years ago, and its purely a homelab now.
