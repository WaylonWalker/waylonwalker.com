Sad day yesterday.  We discovered that our freezer was left cracked over a day or so.  Kids self serviced themselves to some sausage dogs at some point and wedged the box in the door.  Everything was over 40F and done.

Lessons learned for everyone.  For the kids, see something say something, food should not come out of a freezer soft and barely fridge temp.  For the parents, don't get in a rush when loading the freezer.  If something doesn't quite look like it's going to stay out, it probably won't and next person to use it will pay... Or you will pay when they don't notice.  Last lesson for everyone, when you come home late and tired from a family trip to Grandma's and hear beeping it's probably important and investigate.
