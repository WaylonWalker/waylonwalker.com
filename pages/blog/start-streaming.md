I recently started streaming on
[twitch.tv/waylonwalker](https://www.twitch.tv/waylonwalker) and it's been a
blast so far.

* python
* kedro
* Data Science
* Data Engineering
* webdev
* digital gardening

## Kedro Spaceflights

It all started with
[kedro/issues/606](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues/606), Yetu
called out for users of kedro to record themselves doing a walk through of
their tutorials.  I wanted to do this, but was really stuck at the fact that
recording or editing somewhat polished vide is quite time consuming for me.

## Inspiration

My introduction to twitch came from
[twitch.tv/theprimeagen](https://twitch.tv/theprimeagen). I watched him on
YouTube, and then decided to drop into a stream.  It was so fun to watch him
live that I started following others in the science and tech category.

* [twitch.tv/teej_dv](https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv) Brilliant neovim core dev, I learn a bunch about nvim every time I watch.
* [twitch.tv/cmgriffing](https://www.twitch.tv/cmgriffing) Super Chill and engaging chat.
* [twitch.tv/cassidoo](https://www.twitch.tv/cassidoo) Fantastic discussion/chat.
* [twitch.tv/anthonywritescode](https://www.twitch.tv/anthonywritescode) Building the python ecosystem.
* [twitch.tv/kierisi](https://www.twitch.tv/kierisi) Exploring data in r-studio, taking xgboost to Sliced.

## Streaming What I Do

After taking a jump in with the spaceflights tutorial I realized that it really
was not that hard to do, and I can stream things that I am doing anyways.  I
will be streaming while I build open source kedro plugins, pipelines, and while
I work on my website.

## YouTube

I started storing all the replay, and some clips on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChoRUssc5HoO-xQ9hUKZ1mA).  If that
is more of your thing be sure to check it out.  To be completely honest the  editing/ clips will likely come at a minimum, as they take me a lot more time to edit.  I would greatly appreciate
anyone who subscribes to help me get to the 100 subscriber baseline to get my
custom url.

Come join me while I try to figure out what I am doing.
