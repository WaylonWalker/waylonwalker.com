porta-john design update, working on moving the seams to line up with an edge to eliminate long noticable seams.  These seams are required because I don't have a printer big enough to print this in one shot.

hotswaps are going in.  I'm getting really excited for hotswaps as they will make keebs more repairable, and users can self change out the switches if they want.  I can also pre-build them ready to go, and drop in switches at the time of order.  I did learn today that these are hyper specific to gateron, damn all these switch manufacturers and their special pinouts.

Last thing I gotta make more room for wiring the microcontroller and running wires out to the rows and columns, my first prototype build took waay to long to build.
