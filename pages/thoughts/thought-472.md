Theo weighing in on the 2025 job market.  It's no 2018 out there right now, the ratio of jobs to engineers in the market has flipped big time.  Theo as usual really focuses on community, being in a community, and being a good citizen.  At the end of the video Theo weighs in on his experience hiring, and generally it starts with we need someone to do x does anyone know someone, then goes to a more formal internal post, then more formally asking internally does anyone know someone, then maybe to his community, and if he really still needs the person it _might_ become an external post.  These days there are so many good engineers on the market that very few good jobs actually get a posting for in his opinion.
