Tonight I got to stream and knock out a big feature in a side project
that I have really been wanting to knock out.  I made my website builder
themable sot hat users can choose thier own colors without needing to
write any html and css, I am pretty excited for it.  I got to play with
the kids early on, and made a hard stop where I was going to stop and do
my own thing.  I think this will help me get a few more hours for myself
here and there.
