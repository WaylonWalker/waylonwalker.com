Nicely worded Cassidy!  Javascript can be too much, it can bog down low powered devices, we can ship so much that its untenable on poor connections.  It can be argued that its a bad language and putting it on the server is a mistake, but it brings sites to life.  It makes it possible to extend the static nature of html/css with just a little special spice only your site needs.

I'd add to the argument that a lot of js should go away over time.  Over time libraries such as jquery have fallen out of use, not because they are bad, or have been replaced by new libraries, but because the browser has adopted most of the functionality that jquery brought.

As a primarily python dev I'd really like to see htmx die a very similar graceful death.  There have been several iterations on this idea, and the crux of it is very similar, give the ability to use HTTP verbs right inside html with some instruction of when to apply them and what to apply them to.

No js should not go away, it never will, we will always find new patterns that the browser should take, sites will always need a small bit of spice to bring them to life.
