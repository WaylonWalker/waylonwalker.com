## It's been awhile

It's been quite awhile since I have done a gratitude journal, like really long,
but lately i've felt that it's time to start back up again.

## Doc

Lately I've been battling some nasty allergies, today I
went to the doctor to get checked out and prescribed some
medication that I think is going to make a big difference.
Aparantly my nose was pretty filled up.  I could
definitely feel some immediate relief as my nose started
clearing up through the day. I am so grateful that
Rhiannon pushed me to getting checked out.  I am so
grateful that my doctor took me back in as a patient after
not seeing him for so long though the pandemic.  Finally I
am ready for some relief.
