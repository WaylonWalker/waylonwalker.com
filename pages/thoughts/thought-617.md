Astral is doing great things in the python industry.  They are disrupting entire categories of tools with extremely fast, easy to use, and feature rich alternatives that make it really hard to keep using the incumbent.   So far I am seeing no signs of evil, sometimes with such a disrupter there is some sort of downside that make it hard to want to do the switch.  In the interview they even mention things like leaning on lsp so that it works across all editors rather than building out vscode integrations that work for **most** developers.  As a neovim user I greatly apreciate this.
