description:
Waylon Walker is a Senior Software Engineer who specializes in data pipelines
and Python-based web platforms.  He runs a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster in his
basement, built his own static site generator because he got tired of bloated
Node modules, and writes about Python, Linux, neovim, and the intersection of
tech and family life.  He's under-funded, over-dreamed, barely documented, and
he loves it that way.

primary_topics:
- Python (data pipelines, kedro, pandas, testing)
- AI/LLMs and agentic coding (Claude, vibe coding, LLM workflows)
- Kubernetes and homelab (bare-metal cluster, self-hosting)
- Containerization and Docker
- Dotfiles management and Dockerized dotfiles
- Distrobox and containerized development environments
- Neovim and terminal workflows (tmux, zsh, fzf)
- Linux (Arch, Bazzite, Hyprland, dotfiles)
- Developer experience and tooling
- Data engineering and platform engineering

content_types:
- Blog posts - long-form technical and personal writing
- TIL (Today I Learned) - quick technical discoveries
- Hot Tips - short Python/terminal tips with code
- Gratitude - daily gratitude journaling (300+ entries)
- Stars - showcasing interesting GitHub projects
- Shots - image/video posts
- Daily notes - technical ricing, configs, waybar
- Ping - micro-blogging (1-2 sentence thoughts)

tone:
Casually self-deprecating with technical credibility. Conversational like
you're talking to someone at a conference after-party. Not afraid to poke fun
at himself and his projects. Competent but humble. DIY ethic emphasis.
Authentically includes personal details like family, gaming, and skateboarding.

audience:
Beginner to intermediate developers, Python enthusiasts, homelabbers, people
interested in terminal workflows, data engineers, and anyone who appreciates
tech writing that doesn't take itself too seriously.
