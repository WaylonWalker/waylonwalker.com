Nearly finished.  We have the keys to our old house for one more day, and we
are co close to being finished with it.  Rhiannon has been crushing it over
there, like seriously ðŸ¦µ crushing it.  She spent most of the day there with the
move out cleanup maids, and has gone back to pick up the last of the clutter,
skim coat holes in the wall, and paint.  It is looking remarkable over there by
the video I have seen of the place.
