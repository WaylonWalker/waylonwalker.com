Mine is the python debugger. I was a long holdout thinking that print statements were sufficient. That was untill I started having errors crop up in functions that took minutes to run. The thing that I most notably wish I would have known about is post_mortem.

## Example

    [ins] In [4]: def repeater(msg, repeats=1):
             ...:     "repeats messages {repeats} number of times"
             ...:     print(f'{msg}\n' * repeats)

    [ins] In [5]: repeater('hi', 3)
    hi
    hi
    hi

    [ins] In [6]: repeater('hi', 'a')
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-6-0ec595774c81> in <module>
    ----> 1 repeater('hi', 'a')

    <ipython-input-4-530890de75cd> in repeater(msg, repeats)
          1 def repeater(msg, repeats=1):
          2     "repeats messages {repeats} number of times"
    ----> 3     print(f'{msg}\n' * repeats)
          4

# Debug with iPython/Jupyter

    %debug

## Vanilla Debug

    import pdb
    import sys

    pdb.post_mortem(sys.last_traceback)
