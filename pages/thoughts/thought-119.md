        `litestream` is a sick cli tool for steaming replicas of sqlite.  It automatically does daily snapshots, and streams all of the writes to the replica live.


## install

Install is fast using installer, no compilation, just copy the binary and run.

``` bash
curl https://i.wayl.one/benbjohnson/litestream
```
