Making time, I am feeling inspired to write more, everywhere, including in this
journal, I just crossed the 200 mark, but really this should be much higher,
like 2000 if I were to really keep it going daily.  What am I missing right
now, its not the motivation, ability, or desire to write more, its the priority
setting.

These days it does not take me much time to get a post out, render template,
write, publish.  I just really need to make the time to do it.  I need to have
a time of day that is my writing time, do it and move on.  It really helps get
ideas out of my head.

I just watched Speed's [I Tried 30 Viral Health Trends For 30 Days to See
What's Worth It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygR3g0-lts), followed by
Nichola Cole's [10 Reasons You Arenâ€™t Writing Online (And How To Fix
Them)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeE_vPNatUQ&list=PLvLJ46qa__5rQbF1uuzcRiCzag3C5RbnN&index=2).
James from speed reviewed all of the viral health trends at the end, a lot were
garbage or just too much.  One thing he said made him really feel better was
daily journaling, and he was going to keep it.

So today I am grateful for these inspirational posts that not only inspred me
but help identify what I am missing (dedicated time).
