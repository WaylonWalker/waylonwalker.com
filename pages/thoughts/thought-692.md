Vendor lock in disguised as performance.  Nextjs aparantly now streams all of your metadata on the fly with js.  This would obviously kill all seo right, well not if you're on vercel they automatically detect search crawlers and serve the metadata.  Why the f do they need to do this and not just serve everyone the metadata.  The Web is this beautiful place where anyone can create and build amazing things with a relatively low skill.  Js is meant to be enhancement, not degrade the experience of its users.
