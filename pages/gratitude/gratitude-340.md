Landed a good interviewee today and just had a solid conversation for 40 minutes with them.  It was the first one that felt like I was talking to a friend, a coworker.  Someone I could go for a walk with, or spend a late night debugging in the rare occurrencesces that this happens.

A few days back I got out on the trampoline with the kids, we had a great time, popped some fronties as we say, and grabbed a silly picture on the way out.  I'm grateful for the weather to allow it, my lungs getting better to handle it, and our tranmpoline for surviving the winder months.

Great time with the kids on our trampoline
