Playing minecraft with Wyatt today he started a server all on his own and had
me join. All vanilla, only one rule, underground bases.

I spawned into the server and it was already night time. I gathered up some
wood on my way down a tree, and was attacked by zombies before I could get any
tools, so I ran up another tree and crafted a crafting table.

Now to follow the rules, it's time to head underground to build my base.

I made a mistake and died, but look at this view from my respawn point.
