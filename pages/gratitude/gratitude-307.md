First day with kids back in school and it was glorious.  They did great, I think they were ready to be back to seeing their friends every day.  The house was quiet, I stayed home while I'm still coughing non-stop from this bronchitis.  I worked on a bunch of stuff [[2026-resolutions]] was one big one.

Best of all was after school, we all went down to play a round of darts and everyone did so well, there was no arguments and everyone was the best sport always picking up and cheering for whoever was up.  Not trying to mess them up, put them down, or be greedy.  It was a super positive and fun experience.  Now these are the kids we are trying to raise.  The winter break, being sick, stuck inside, not able to do much really got us down, this change of pace back to normal spun us back in.

I printed a hornet that I've wanted to have in my office for awhile today and took time to paint it this evening.  I really like how the bench turned out with a bronzy gold highlight.  Its hard to see in person, but her dress has some shading and distressing along with the pin as well. Her silk even turned out well as a wire.  The model images used elwire and it looked sick, but this will do.
