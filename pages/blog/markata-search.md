A side effect of [[ markata-didyoumean ]] is that we are able to implement some
rudimentary search based on slug, title, tags, and description.

![Replay markata-search-1.mp4](/api/file/fd677374-5ef1-41c7-8845-6de0e10f224b.mp4)

This was first implemented to solve 404 pages giving users a way to try to find
the page that they tried to access.  But it turned out to be a decent way to
search through the docs.
