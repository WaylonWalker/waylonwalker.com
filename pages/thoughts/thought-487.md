> This is a cool new feature coming to bash, I can't think of a use case I have out of the gate, but it looks cool.  I'm thinking this might be good to keep in the back pocket for something like CI where I don't have a hightly tuned bashrc file, and I want a dynamic curl request based on some state that exists as a fille.
