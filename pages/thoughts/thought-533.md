Don't stop learning!  Stop trying because you have a doomer outlook on ai, llms, industry and think they are taking over.  If you have no hope for the future, if you stop now you are cementing in that you will be no good and the ai will be better.  Many, maybe most of us in this industry go here by hard work, long nights of learning, trying to solve problems that our job had.  If llms  take over then the world is going to be a whole lot different, it will be a world you cannot predict or plan for.  For now put your head down and succeed in the world we have today.

TEEJ has some great thoughts on this whole sentiment, put this on for you morning walk or whatever you do.
