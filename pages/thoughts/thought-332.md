markdown it py running in rust claims to be 20x faster.  I'll definitely look into this if markdown it py is ever a bottleneck in my performance.  At first glance it appears that plugins are written in rust not python, and there is no admonition plugin, so I'll keep my eye on it for now, but I can't use it.
