The weather is beautiful, overcast, has an odd humid warmness to the chest and chilly breeze to the skin.  We've been making great progress on our 🎭 theater apple boxes lately.  Figuring out how to jig and batch cuts, we have a pretty good process for it now.  Looks like today I will be able to start cutting out handles and doing round overs.

I just took Ayla to reindeer practice and she was singing the whole way.  That girl can sing.  She has an amazing voice, it's in there and she is learning to control it more and more, I can hear the improvement.  Today she popped out some soprano Galinda and wow, I think it's fantastic.  I'm not vocal coach so I might have my rose tinted dad glasses on here, but it seems like that's her range somehow and she has been trying to make the wrong range work for her
