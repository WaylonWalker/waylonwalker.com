Wild to see the LinkedIn post linked here to see how out of touch this feels.  I find it astonishing that they have something so ingrained into gaming culture as twitch, yet build something like Prime Gaming.  Maybe I have no idea what Prime gaming is, but it feels like the opposite of ownership.  What I get from steam is a sense of ownership.  I own the desktop/laptop/handheld, no one **cough** _nintendo_ **cough cough** cant remotely disable my device for using it inappropriately.  I have a sense of trust with steam that as long as Gabe is alive I own what I paid for and will be able to open up and play anything at any time on any device I want.  It might be a $100 dell workstation raised out of the coorporate refurb bin, it might be a high end machine, It could be my 2010 gateway or my 2045 custom build and they are all likely to play a good amount of my library at some level.  I still understand that I really own nothing and the moment steam turns off its servers its quite likely  that everything is broken, but its by far the best we have.  Far from the status quo we are headed towards with subscription and cloud based gaming.  If they wanted to disrupt steam they did not understand their audience.
