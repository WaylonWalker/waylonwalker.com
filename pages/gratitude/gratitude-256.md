Back to school night was tonight.  So proud of Ayla for how well she does in
school, and how well she makes friends.  I am so grateful for the teachers that
she has had in the past.  We had to go to every past teacher to say hi to them,
it's part of her routine, she loves talking to them.  She got the teacher that
she wanted this year so I forsee the trend continuing.
