> I wonder how much of [killed-by-google](https://killedbygoogle.com/) is due to is [20 percent time](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/787).  Allowing engineers to follow a passion project turns into a real product that doesn't have full backing and support of the company.

similar to DHH as much as I am hurt by reader and all of their privacy BS that comes from ad based revenue I appreciate YouTube and them supporting all of the creators on it.  Giving a platform for small creators the ability to sustain themselves and reach a larch audience without big coorporate rules.
