title: Gratitude 258

First day of school went great for both kids, grateful for everything to come
together in the end.  Buses, paperwork all the timing and everything.  The
middle of the day is now much calmer with the chaos enhanced at either end of
the day as we ramp up for school and bring home all the pent up energy.  Its
fine though its good to have a bit of quiet in the middle.
