I recently discovered [elia](https://github.com/darrenburns/elia) by [darrenburns](https://github.com/darrenburns), and it's truly impressive.

A snappy, keyboard-centric terminal user interface for interacting with large language models. Chat with ChatGPT, Claude, Llama 3, Phi 3, Mistral, Gemma and more.
