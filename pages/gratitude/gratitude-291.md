Last night we took a sample box to the theater and the director loved it.  So happy with the progress that we are making, and excited to get them all assembled for the show.

I took Wyatt to Chuck e cheese for the first time ever last night with a friend of his.  He had an absolute blast with his friend.  I'm happy for him to develop new friendships with people his age, he is doing so fantastic.
