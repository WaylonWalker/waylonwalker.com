Interesting how confidently he says we can easily go to the top.  really makes you wonder what we the normies are leaving on the table by using these general purpose models and what could be achieved with really tuned in models.  Could I make an automatic blog tagger more accurately, maybe smaller, maybe tuned so well it runs fine on cpu?
