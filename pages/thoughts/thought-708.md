> David's design on his blog is fantastic likely from years of small improvements like this converting ugly quotes to pretty quotes and optimizing fonts.

> It’s common for markdown libraries to convert the first to the second like my build script does.

This is new to me, I had no idea that markdown libraries did this, I'm now interested if markdown-it does it.

> For subsetting I use the fontTools library but I’ve no idea how to setup Python environments. I got it working once and failed to document the process. 

David, David, David, I'm sorry python has done you this dirty.  I should do a post on making python environments in the age of [[ uv ]].  You got options to run in docker/podman, a whole ass vm, uv venv, uvx, uv run, uv script, python -m venv, virtualenv, poetry, hatch, and too many more.  The ones that matter are containers or uv.
