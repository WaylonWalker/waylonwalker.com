Pesos is the act of Publish Elsewhere Syncicate to Own Site.  It is an indieweb
concept that I recently started applying to my own site.

here does it skip again

!!! note
    See <https://indieweb.org/PESOS> for more information, they have a ton of
    information about the indieweb

In short it is the concept of pulling data from other sites that you use and
republishing it to your own site.  This gives a single source of information
for you, and protection against sites and apis changing or rug pulling.  Other
  people might have a lot more use cases for this, but I already begin a lot of
  my data right on my site.

## GitHub stars

I am using the github api to get a list of my stars and then create posts in
the github repo for my blog.  This allows me to keep track of things I star on
GitHub in my own way, and share them out with my rss feeds.
