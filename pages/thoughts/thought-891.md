Kelsey has a really good lightbulb moment here about platform engineering.

> "if you had to do all the deployments for the entire company what questions would you ask of the development team?"

That's your api, your platform, this is your product as a platform engineer.  It's not images, docker, terraform, hcl, yaml, kubernetes, It's building out the right api for your company to deploy its products effectively.
