I'm totally with Prime here, there is something about the read only, mouse clicking part of my brain that causes me to be more critical of the code at a different level.  It doesn't hit the part of my brain thinking about the edit or how to do the edit, it hits a part thats thinking about how I will have to deal with the code moving forward.
