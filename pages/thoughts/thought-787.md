> Googles 20 percent time is fascinating to me.  It seems like a great way for engineers to fill up their tank with new skills, passion projects, and the need to scratch an itch.  To me these days it feels like something that would incentivize good talent to join.

I can remember back earlier in my career December and January were slow months for big companies.  Riddled with vacation and annual planning cycle.  I would use this time to create tools and libraries that would help me move quicker throughout the year.  

I clearly remember having a conversation with a colleague several salary grades ahead of me come mid February asking what I was up to.  I was furiously pecking away at some of these projects while he let me know that he had been waiting for this years plan for months and had no tasks from the boss.

> That said, I don’t think any major tech company is going to adopt 20% time these days. It’s too chaotic, too hard to manage and impossible to measure.

This line from Ted feels exactly why 20 percent time generally blows up and likely turns into another [killed-by-google](https://killedbygoogle.com/) product that has a small user base and is furious about it being killed.  With enough of these at least one **cough** _reader_ **cough** has affected us all.
