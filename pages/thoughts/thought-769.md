The message so many of us need to hear, stop scrolling and start creating.  I'm not sure that I have a heavy issue with this, I barely scroll the socials anymore, I have my own rss reader curated with people that I enjoy consuming from.  YT is often done as a family activity (with my wife) or listening while doing something like dishes.  But I think I've been on the other side of this for awhile.  There's something that ticks my brain by twiddling with linux nonsensically or `pip install thing-i-heard-about-today` and try it.  I'm not imune  though, I often fill gaps in the day with nonsense short content, but try to avoid the short trap.

!!! note

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
    about someone else's content online #thoughts
