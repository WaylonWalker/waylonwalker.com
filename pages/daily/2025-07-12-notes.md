Starting the polkit agent for hyperland arch to handle permission elevation for
desktop applications.

!!! error 

    An error occurred while accessing 'bazzite-nvidia_razorcrest', the system
    responded: Cannot request authentication for this action. The PolicyKit
    authentication system appears to be not available.: Not authorized to
    perform operation

``` config
exec-once = waybar & hyprpaper & $terminal & polkit & swaync & /usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1
```

!!! GIPPITY

    üß† Why this happens:
    Polkit handles permission elevation for desktop apps.

    Dolphin uses udisks2 to mount drives, which asks Polkit for permission.

    If you don't run a Polkit agent, you won't be able to authorize mount actions from the GUI.
