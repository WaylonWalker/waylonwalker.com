> I've kinda fallen out of using direnv now that a lot of my projects use hatch, I generally just hatch shell into them.  I just need to make sure I go through all of them and make my installer uv.  Now I've been thinking about making uv my only needed dependency to run a python project and leaning more to something like `uv run --with . uvicorn myapp --reload`
