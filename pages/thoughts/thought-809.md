> This is an insane level of agentic llm use, the author claims to not even use his filesystem anymore, its too cumbersome to find where downloads and documents are and way too easy to ask an agent to move all pdf's from downloads to documents.

This scares me on multiple levels, theres the epidemic of ai datacenters and ai companies burning cash, burning through gpu's and api calls to a giant data center just to move files sounds absolutely insane to me.

Then there is the level of accuracy.  There's a level of interpretation that happens with english that does not happen in code, code generally does what it does repeatably.  The examples of "Move old backups to archive" is so open for interpretation that its ready to ruin your day, which backup, which archive, how old?  Dude is ready to loose his files.

Last is privacy, there is going to be a privacy epidemic that is going to pwn so many people giving these things full access to email, chat, ALL of YOUR FILES, and computer, your whole network.

Look I get it this is where things are going, but dude is early, like too early.  These things need to become far more accurate, less power hungry, and run locally before I give up my whole filesystem.
