Getting ready to batch out 18 apple boxes for the local theater.  Need to step
up my woodworking tool game here quick on a low budget.  Whipped this up up and
built the prototype box , went really well. We have 4 in the arsenal now, might
do 4 more if we need more assembly capacity.  Pretty proud of the first 3d
printed thread project here.  The design for good 3d prints can be quite
different with its anisotropic strength and hollow sections being nearly
weightless when compared to traditional manufacturing methods.  Its so fun to
be able to do it for almost no cost right in my home office.
