> This is super cool, thanks to Brodie for reading me this content as I do household chores.  [lowtech magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) is a website ran completely on solar power with only enough battery backup to cover most days.  Adding enough to cover all days would increase its carbon footprint and negate the carbon offset of the solar panels it runs on.  

It's fascinating to see a web server running completely off grid in a close power system.  These interesting websites are fascinating keep em coming Brodie.
