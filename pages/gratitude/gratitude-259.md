[[ 2025-08-14-notes ]] made great progress on my [[ shots ]] feed.  Currently
its just a feed of family photos, this was not my original intent, but I really
like it so I might have to have yet more feeds so that I can keep my family
only shots feed as I add more shots that are non family.  I'm really happy with
how the page is turning out, reminds me of old instagram.  I never got SUPER
deep in instagram, but used it a bit and can appreciate the nostalgia of
setting up an instagram grid, maybe that's still a thing.  This was fun to
build out nearly completely out of my brain, currently at work I have a design
related thing, not this but close enough, and I have been trying to get ai to
just do this part for me and its failing really bad.  It always amazes me at
how good ai can kick off designs and make something that looks fine, but when
prompted to build what you want or need it really falls flat.  This took quite
a turn for a gratitude post, what I'm trying to say is that I'm really happy
and excited where [[ shots ]] is going.
