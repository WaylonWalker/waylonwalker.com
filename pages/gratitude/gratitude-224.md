Today Ayla had so much support from all over show up.  We had Friends from
Iowa, Family from Iowa, more friends from Iowa, her 3rd grade teacher, and a
best friend from school.  I am so proud of her and happy for the support that
she is getting!  Great work Ayla, Two more shows to go tomorrow.  Its going to
be such a sudden change from chaos to silence in this house.
