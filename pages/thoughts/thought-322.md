> Well spoken prime. Co-pilot is a fantastic tool for templating, boilerplate, or just getting something done that is just outside your knowledge or care to know.  Bit if you really want to learn something, you need to use your hands.  Reading the solution only gives you the happy path.  This does not give you that path that most people would take, and completely misses debugging.  If you are very new and learning it's unlikely that you can write large blocks of code without running a test or a script to try it.  Taking these shortcuts will hinder your ability to do it yourself.

If I were to devils advocate here, copilot is still not the greatest at the big picture, you still have to drive, and tell it I want to use python, fastapi, I want to load settings from .env.  taking these shortcuts can help you move quick and get the big picture.  This is especially helpful for someone who might know one language or framework and is trying a different one, but at some point you need to do the work and learn if you are going to be effective.
