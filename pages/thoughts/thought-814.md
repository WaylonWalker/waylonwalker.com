This man feels sad, he never had a chance to bloom.  He was stuck behind the drudgery of jira tickets.  This is what the consultant driven  agile has got us.  Its ripped out all the thinking and creativity, its left us with moving tickets across the board, not allowed time to run on an idea when we have one.  Not allowed to do extra work or refactoring in a module that we are already in.  pushed to move faster for less.  

I feel like this mans experience has been quite different from my own and I'm grateful to have some leeway to be creative and do some meaningful work outside the jira board.  I'm grateful to be able to provide a good income for my family without taking on all the risk myself.
