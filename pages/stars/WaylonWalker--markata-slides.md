Looking for inspiration? [markata-slides](https://github.com/WaylonWalker/markata-slides) by [WaylonWalker](https://github.com/WaylonWalker).

A slides plugin for markata that allows you to create presentations in markdown from the comfort of your favorite editor.  Each new h2 tag (## in markdown) becomes a new slide.  This plugin leverages the built-in feeds plugin for navigation, and adds in some hotkeys (j/k) to go the the previous and next slides.
