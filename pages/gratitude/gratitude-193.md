Big ride tonight.  Dobby has been doing fantastically on the bike, we ended up
going on our first big ride outside of our neighborhood.  He is progressing so
quickly.  He does so good at setting the pace and running right beside me with
a slack leash.  Sometimes he gets distracted, but not too much.  I am just so
grateful that we have picked up this activity together, its been great for us.
