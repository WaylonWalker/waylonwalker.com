Five star episode with Jarod and Adam shootin the crap.

> [The massive Cease and Desist](https://opentofu.org/blog/our-response-to-hashicorps-cease-and-desist/)

Sucks that the guest had to back out, what a wild world 2024 is.  Filled with license and pricing changes.

> [From Vim to Zed](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/from-vim-to-zed)

Interesting to hear the journey into zed, way to go Thorston diving all the way into working at zed.

>	[Boston Dynamics' new Atlas](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/boston-dynamics-debuts-humanoid-robot-destined-for-commercialization)

I later saw this through a YT short, and man does it hold up to the creepy level that they described.

> [MarkdownDown](https://markdowndown.vercel.app/)
