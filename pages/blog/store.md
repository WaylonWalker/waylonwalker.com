## Skateboard Wall Mount

I've used these skateboard wall mounts for years, I have 5 in my office
featuring new decks in the queue, and probably 10 in the garage to display used
decks, and fully assembled boards for me and my kids.  I use these for both
regular popscicle boards and longboards, but if you are putting up a thicker
longboard go with the thicker size.
