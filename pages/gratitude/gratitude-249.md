First day back from vacation and we are getting hit with wildfire smoke from
the Grand Canyon.  Could not have worked out better to already be home in our
house that is still a bit tighter and cooler than the airbnb that we were in.
Its at a level that affects sensitive groups that include our family.  Despite
the weather being much lower now than it has been all summer, we are still
locked up, albeit refreshed from our vacation.

We did stop at a park for about 15 minutes in between doc appointments for
Wyatt, Ayla picked out the park which included a sledding hill we had to check
out and want to come back to in the winter.
