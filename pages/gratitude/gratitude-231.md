Tonight Ayla and I went to two different parks and had a blast just being super
silly.  She recorded some silly videos of us doing skits talking about the part
in my day and it was super fun.  My phone wouldnt stick to the swing in
horizontal mode so I couldnt get us both in the frame at the same time, but I
grabbed a frame of her with just the happiest face.
