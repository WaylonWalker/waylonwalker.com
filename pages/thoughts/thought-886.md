> This looks like a really good low cost option for some workholding.  There is never a shortage of workholding in the shop and everything has a place.  Having something low cost that you can have a bunch of makes a lot of sense.  Maybe you still need a super scucum unit for really clamping the shit out of something, but this easily covers most use cases in a garage workshop.  I want to build it.
