I've used this knife sharpener that I printed for a few years now.  I thought
that it was based on the Russian designed TSPROF, but in looking through the
history it looks very similar to the USA Edge Pro Inc Apex designs that goes
back to the 1990's.  The angle isn't quite holding like it used to.  I've got a
lot of ideas for my own model, but for now I'm going to print some spacers to
help get repeatable angles.
