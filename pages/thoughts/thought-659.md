> I suffer hard from NIH, I'm cheap, I like building things, I hate reading the docs, the perfect recipe for some bad NIH.  I really like DHH's take here.  If no one builds anything new we get stuck with the same old shit.  I think theres a lot of things that as far as my use case is concerned feature complete and needs no more.  I would just build with it or on it, but not re-invent.  It's a slippery slope.
