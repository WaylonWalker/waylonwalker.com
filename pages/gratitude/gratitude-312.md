Monday, and it's so calm being home in an empty house on these days.  I'm still not getting any better, this cough will not go away and I am holding myself back from going into the office for now.  I would not like every single day to be this lonely in life, but I do enjoy it on occasion.  Its very relaxing, especially when you have been sick.  I'm an only child who lived far from anyone else at heart and was tuned to entertain myself.  I'm grateful that my energy is returning and getting better every day, sad that coughing fits still stir up with little talking or activity.  Lets hope for some better answers tomorrow.
