Today Wyatt landed his first front flip on the trampoline to feet.  It was
quite stumbly, but I've told him all along I count anything that he stays up
on, no matter how sloppy.  Everyone was super happy and supportive for him, he
has been working on this for probably near a month.  I first notices how close
he was I set him a challenge and we worked hard on it all that week and after 4
days I got it.  I think after that he lost a bit of steam, but has been working
pretty hard on it still.  The last few days he has been really close, landing
on his feet, holding some weight, but loosing balance.  This has really
inspired him to kick it back into gear and this morning he got it.  I am so
proud of him!!!!
