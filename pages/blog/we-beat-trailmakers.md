Today we broke through the atmosphere in trailmakers ready for pickup from
those back at mission conrol.

Today we hit 100% of the required parts required to build the space ship and
leave the atmosphere of the planet that the story is set in.  Trailmakers is a
game where you design and build your own vehicles.  The campaign mode standed
is a story where you are in a high tech freighter ship that crash lands on a
distant planet.  Your crew back home can come as far as the planet your on but
cannot break through the atmosphere.  Your job is to collect all the wreckage
and gain all the parts required for a space ship build to take you out of the
atmosphere to meet them.

There were a couple really heavy salvages to gather up, this one is high in the
floating islands and is the cockpit fo the space ship.

I thought this was a cool shot of one of our builds with the suspension fully
squatted out with a heavy load on the back.

## Multiple Salvages

It took us way to long to realize that we had enough power cores to add a bunch
of tractor beams to do multiple salvages at once. Each tractor beam only has
the ability to pick up one salvage at a time.

## Some wild moments

This clip brought both of us to curled over laughter, I wish I had recording on
to get a full clip of it, this screenshot is the best I got.  What happened was
my son was being super silly and blew us up, but somehow the seat of the last
build stayed in while we respawnd and our new vehicle picked it up.  Not only
that, but the broken seat was still usable and he was able to sit in it!

## acheivements status

Currently I am quite a ways from getting 100% of the achievements for the game.
I think I will finish 100% of the stranded campaign because it is super fun,
but probably wont 100% it.
