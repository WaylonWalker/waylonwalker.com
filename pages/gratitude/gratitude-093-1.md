### Let's get outside

The weather outside lately has been rainy and dreary, making it difficult for us to get outside much.  Yesterday there was a break of great weather.  The kids and I took advantage of the opportunity.  We got outside to go on walks, to parks, and even was able to try to fly a little bit, though it was a bit windy for flying.
