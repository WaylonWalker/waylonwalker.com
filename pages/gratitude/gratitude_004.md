#### Sleep

It does not get enough recognition, some good quality rest is very benefitial to start off a good day.  Yesterday I was dragging.. hard.  Wyatt was up at 2 A.M. and I was the one to be up with him... for awhile.  Today, he was up early again, but let me sleep, then proceeded to take a morning nap. This combined with an early rest time started my day off on a good note.  I was able to wake up when ready, and start my day at my own pace.  I was able to get coffee and breakfast before being asked to do much.

#### coffee

I enjoy starting my day off with a nice cup of coffee.  Today, I had a nice fresh thirty-thirty guatememala.  I am very grateful that we are able to afford nice coffee, it really energizes me compared to the really dark mass produced coffee that is typically found everywhere.
