Well done write up about reflecting solar energy back to earth from low orbit space.  I did not know this was a thing, apparently it is/isn't.  Solar is a great technology, its largest limitations are that its not consistent.  This tech does not fix this problem, what does is efficient long term storage.  I've seen some crazy ideas going back to my days in school, maybe elementry school.  Theres a lot of innovative ways to store potential energy by moving heavy objects uphill whether fluid or solid.  The issue is that energy storage at grid scale is HUGE and not efficient enough.  Even assuming this idea had any legs at all, it still doesn't solve the problem of inconsistent power because it still cant go through clouds!
