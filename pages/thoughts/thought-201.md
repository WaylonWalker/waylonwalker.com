> Great take on low code.  I have definitely felt the pressure of being presented low code options, "look it does almost everything you need, and you can do it without code."  Granted there are tons of great low code environments that serve their markets well (things like zapier).

As pointed out here when they fall short rather than being hard, it goes to nearly impossible.  As Theo points out here many applications follow an 80/20 rule.  80% of the app is really easy to put together, and takes about 20% of the time, probably less.  What no code does is it takes that 80% that is already easy, makes it even easier ( pitches it as faster whether or not that is true ), and makes the last 20% of the project impossibly hard to create and maintain, so you just should have picked a tool that had the capability of doing the whole thing from the start anyways.
