#### Pick me up

Sometimes you just need a bit of help and it is hard to pick yourself up.  This morning was one of those days.  I just felt overwhelmed and like there was no stopping it.  Rhiannon gave me a call and after talking through some things I felt a huge weight lifted.  I wouldn't say that I was healed, but I would say I was on a good trajectory.  It's really hard to battle things as a family. We are all in it together and that picking each other up will help everyone.
