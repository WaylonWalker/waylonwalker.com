Not a year goes by where this is not a tough day for her, but every year
progress is made.  Healing was put on hold for many years, and did not
start until she was truly able to grieve for what was lost.  Since then
she has made so many improvements to herself, she has put in so much
work that it is easier.  The hard days around this one get fewer and
fewer.  Her power on this day grows strong.  All I can say is that I am
damn proud of what she has accomplished.
