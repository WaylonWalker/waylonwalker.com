This is a sick no-build version of tailwind.  I have a couple of projects that the build step of tailwind is cumbersome on, mostly because they are for non-js devs.  Some are for backend python devs, some are for folks that mostly want markdown with some styles.  This is a perfect no-build tailwind alternative.
