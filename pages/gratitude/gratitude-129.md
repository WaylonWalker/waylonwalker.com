title: Gratitude 129

---

It all started when we decided to celebrate buying our house ðŸŽ‰.  We decided
screw making supper and doing dishes, we are going to order something.  We got
pizza for the kids and burritos for the parents.  Rhiannons did not come out
quite as good as she would have hoped, so she barely ate any.  Little did she
know the storm that burrito bowl was brewing.  She was throwing up all last
night and just trying to get comfortable and make it through the day today.  I
am very grateful for our kids patience and understanding trying to get her what
she needs to get through the day.  Sadly we are likely going to have to cancel
our SuperCross date night tonight to let her finally get some rest, but we can
always watch it not live tomorrow.  Let's hope for a better day for her
tomorrow.
