#### I slept in

Today has been a really relaxing day!  I woke up this morning Rhiannon was with Ayla, and Wyatt was downstairs with some friends staying in the house, so I continued sleeping until I was ready to get up.  After getting up I helped Ayla with potty training for awhile,  in which we racked up 3 sticker! Then Wyatt and I went out sledding in this epic snow that we were blessed with today.  It was a thick heavy, and perfect sledding snow.  We built a tall takeoff ramp, and continued sledding for quite awile.  It was a bit tiring from the weight of the snow, but it was super fun.  The reason that I say that we were blessed with this snow is that the fires have stopped.  Every trip we  leave the house this past week has ended up with us running into a thick smoke from folks burning grass and brush.  This landed us in the hospital once, and Rhiannon in strong pain the other times.
