Someone has created a knock off of the ltt screwdriver and made it printable, and it works really well.  I have one printed with 6 different bitholders.  I popped some labels on them in bambu studio as I printed to mark them for metric/inch and so on.

I've had mine for about a year now, and I use it quite often.  I used to be a dedicated screwdriver kind of guy, but as life has changed I'm not working out of a shop with tools at reach as much, I'm grabbing a couple of items and heading to a job in the house or a neighbors house.  It's not 30s to grab just the right dedicated screwdriver anymore.  Also having some setup with hex and torx is a game changer.  It's also super handy that you can just pop the bits right into a drill or impact.

Highly recommended print.  Sorry for not buying the real deal Linux, I got kids to feed here.  I owe you a t-shirt order or something.
