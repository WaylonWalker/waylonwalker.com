Happy New Years  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.  Today we played Hangry, a new game that we got for Christmas as
a whole family.  It was a freaking blast!  The whole family was belly laughing
through most of it.  I am so grateful that Rhiannon was able to tough through at
least one round of it despite her illness that's coming on.
