> I'm digging these web2app's from DHH's omarchy for setting up an opinionated archlinux hyprland.  This gives a way to quickly open a web app as an app either with a hotkey or run launcher in its own dedicated window that you can put on it's own workspace.  I really like a workflow of keeping one window per workspace on one monitor and I can quickly navigate between apps with a single hotkey.  This gives you the power to switch through things like chat, terminal, browser, steam game with blazing speed from the keybaord, no clicking no searching, just going directly to it.
