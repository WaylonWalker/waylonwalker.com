Today felt like a busy day.  It was a nice day outside so we got a couple of
bike rides in.  Wyatt and I did a big scooter ride in the day and had a great
time doing it.  Then after supper Wyatt, Ayla and I went out again for a ride
through the neighborhood.  Very grateful for the fantastic weather that is
allowing this for us.
