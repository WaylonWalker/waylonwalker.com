Today is the first day of summer, and the last day of work before a long
Memorial day weekend.  Kid energy is high, I'm grateful for the weekend to
start transitioning us into summer.  As hard as it is to have them so dependent
on us, I am so grateful to be so involved in our kids's life.  We are learning
to find the balance between needing a parent involved in everything and
nothing.  I love playing with them and being involved in everything they do,
but they do need to learn some independence and do some things on their own.
During the school year they get used to having a parent playing with them for a
large portion of their time at home.  I am so grateful that this is the case,
but not feasible in summer.
