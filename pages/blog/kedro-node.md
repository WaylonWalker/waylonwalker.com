The Kedro node is an essential part of the pipeline. It defines what catalog
entries get passed in, what function gets ran, and the catalog entry to save
the results under.

## The node function

The node function is the most common and reccomended way to define kedro nodes.
It is a function that constructs and returns `Node` objects for you.

## Creating your first kedro node

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

def identity(df):
    "a function that returns itself"
    return df

my_first_node = node(
   func=identity,
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['int',]
   )
```

### function

The `func` passed into node can be any callable that accepts the inputs yout
have specified, and returns the correct output that you specify as your output.

- any callable
- a function you write
- a function from a library
- class constructor
- lambda function
- partial function
- literally any callable

```python
import pandas as pd
from kedro.pipeline import node

range_node = node(lambda: range(100), None, "range", name="range"),
dataframe_node = node(pd.DataFrame, "range", "df"),
```

#### Using a lambda as a function

I keep my nodes short and sweet. They do one thing and do it well. I turn
almost every DataFrame transformation into its own node. It makes it must
easier to pull catalog entries, than firing up the pipeline, running it,
and starting a debugger. For this reason many of my nodes are build from
inline lambdas.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

my_first_node = node(
   func=lambda x: x,
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['int',]
   )

my_first_node = node(
   func=lambda cars: cars[['mpg', 'cyl', 'disp',]].query('disp>200'),
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['pri',]
   )
```

#### Using a partial function

I prefer the simplicity of lambdas, but many others prefer using a partial as
it can yield a better docstring, node name, and easier to reuse. I name all of
my nodes anyways, never look at the docstring of a partial, and almost always
only use them on a single node or set of nodes constructed together. So I
prefer the readablility of the lambda most of the time, but if you like
partials better, or need to assign it to a variable and reuse it, here are some
partial examples.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node
from functools import partial, update_wrapper

def divide(array, by):
    return [i/by for i in array]

halfer = update_wrapper(partial(divide, by=2), divide)

my_halfer_node = node(
   func=halfer,
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['int',]
   )
```

We can achieve the same results that the partial gave with this lambda.

```python
my_halfer_node = node(
   func=lambda array: divide(array, 2),
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['int',]
   )
```

To further show the point that any callable can be out node's `func`, I have
made a partial from the `pd.DataFrame` class that has column names pre
populated.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node
import pandas as pd
from functools import partial, update_wrapper

MyDataFrame = update_wrapper(partial(pd.DataFrame, columns=["mycol"]), pd.DataFrame)

range_node = node(lambda: range(100), None, "range", name="range"),
dataframe_node = node(MyDataFrame, "range", "df"),
```

### inputs/outputs

kedro inputs and outputs can be `None`, a catalog entry, or a dict mapping the functions
keyword arguments to catalog entries. Catalog entries are always represented
as a string matching the key of the catalog entry you want to load.

#### None

_no catalog entries_

Sometimes you may want to have a node without any inputs. This node may be
used to generate some data from scratch, or fetch some data that does not have
an existing DataSet type setup. DataSets are easy to setup, simply fork one of
kedros built in ones and use it, but for one or two nodes the setup may not be
worth it.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

random_100_node = node(
   func=lambda: random.sample(range(0, 100), 100),
   inputs=None,
   output='random_100',
   name='create_random_100',
   )
```

#### str

_one catalog entry_

This is by far the most common input that you will use. This will simply tell
kedro what dataset to load behind the scenes and passin to the function that
you provide.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

random_100_node = node(
   func=lambda random_100: [x**2 for x in random_100],
   inputs='random_100',
   output='random_squared',
   name='create_random_squared',
   )
```

> Note, I am using a lot of lambdas here for simplicity as each function so far
> is a simple one-liner. These could also be a regular function if you are
> uncomfortable with lambdas.

#### list

_several catalog entries, passed in by position_

In order to start passing in more than one DataSet into a kedro node you need
to use a list or dictionary as the input. Using a list is convenient for a
small number of inputs.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

random_100_node = node(
   func=lambda random_100, random_squared: list(zip(random_100, random_squared)
   inputs=['random_100', 'random_squared'],
   output='random_join',
   name='create_random_join',
   )
```

#### dict

_several catalog entries, passed in by name_

kedro will unpack dictionaries into your function if you pass in a dictionary.
In code review I start suggesting converting from a list to dict at 3 and
require it above 5. It gets way too hard to refactor and move things while
keeping track of the order of really long sets of inputs. Passing them in by
name, as a dictionary, makes it such that order no longer matters.

```python
from kedro.pipeline import node

random_100_node = node(
   func=lambda x, y: list(zip(x, y)),
   inputs={'x': 'random_100', 'y':'random_squared'},
   output='random_join',
   name='create_random_join',
   )
```

> Switch from list to dict inputs between 3 and five inputs to improve
> readability and prevent ordering mistakes.

### tags

Tags provide an easy way to add a label nodes for something to interact with
them. This may be a node that we want a plugin to modify or a set of nodes
that we want quick access to during development.

Tags are always passed in as a list of strings. They must be a 1-d data
structure. You may create that data structure however you want, but its still
just a list of strings. Below I have set a global variable `TAGS` that I want
to apply to every node within a given module, then I splat it into every nodes
tags. This lets me easily apply a whole set of tags to an entire module of
nodes. I can easily modify that list of nodes if I wanted to, but its acually
rare that I do.

```python
TAGS = ['cars']

my_first_node = node(
   func=identity,
   inputs='raw_cars',
   output='int_cars',
   tags=['int', *TAGS]
   )

```

```python
# get a pipeline of one node
one_node = pipeline.only_nodes_with_tags('int')

# get a pipeline of a few nodes
one_node = pipeline.only_nodes_with_tags('raw', 'int')
```

### name

The name attribute is simple, it's the name of the node. Later you can use the
name to find the node or all nodes named a particular way. This name will also
show up in the logs provided by kedro or a plugin so naming things well makes
everything much easier to read.

Consistent naming makes it easier to do things like extracting nodes out of a
pipeline, running them, and making pipelines from them.

```python
# get a pipeline of one node
one_node = pipeline.only_nodes('a_raw_cars')

# get a pipeline of a few nodes
one_node = pipeline.only_nodes('a_raw_cars', 'a_raw_trains')

# create a pipeline by nodes that contain 'raw' in the name
raw_nodes = Pipeline([node for node in pipeline.nodes if 'raw' in node.name])
```

> want something a bit more robust.

## Using PartitionedDataSets

```python
def timeseries_partitioned(cars: Dict):
    return {k:len(car()) for k, car in cars.items()}

nodes.append(
        node(
            func=timeseries_partitioned,
            inputs='int_cars_partitioned',
            outputs='int_cars_timeseries_partitioned',
            name='create_int_cars_timeseries_partitioned',
            )
        )
```

## Using IncrementalDataSets

```python
def timeseries_incremental(cars: Dict):
    return {k:len(car) for k, car in cars.items()}

nodes.append(
        node(
            func=timeseries_incremental,
            inputs='int_cars_incremental',
            outputs='int_cars_timeseries_incremental',
            name='create_int_cars_timeseries_incremental',
            )
        )
```

## Execution order

Execution order is set by resolving catalog dependencies. I imagine kedro taking
a razer blade tool and slicing out all nodes with completed dependencies,
throwing those in a bag drawing them out one by one randomly, then when the bag
is full it slices more out and repeats until there are no more nodes. This idea
of randomness can be really maddening when there are two separate issues on your
pipeline. If you are debugging an error in your pipeline run the erroring node
by itself.

## Running specific nodes

_the power of the DAG_

One of the greatest benefits of using kedro is that it gives you a Pipeline
object that is a DAG. This is a powerful object that can quickly pull decide a
set of nodes to run when you tell it to run to or from somewhere. Somewhere
being either a catalog entry or node.
