Interesting takes on Diun here. I agree that I like to be in control of updates and pinning not to latest.  both seemed like they weren't going to run it because they can look up the latest version.  Maybe I need to be less aggressive on keeping things up to date and its a me problem.  I just got diun setup and hooked into ntfy, and I kinda like the automated checklist of new images that I can review and update.

To be a bit more clear, having control over changes coming in from others,  even if I dont care to see the changelog, it is nice to roll out an update, have it in your git history, watch it deploy and work like before, if not roll back and read the changelog.  For internal applications I'm down for automated releases like argo image updater give you, this thing has already gone through review, launch the damn thing at least to a dev space.
