> Always enjoy a good read through someone elses setup.  I appreciate the desire for pi clusters they are cute, they seem cheap, but feel a bit overrated (at least for those of us with relatively cheap electricity).  I love seeing the refurb "tiny desktops" getting a second useful life in a homelab after they have serve their useful life in the corporate world sitting behind the monitor of some reception desk.  These things rock, they are underrated, x86_64, not ARM, so they just work.  Until ARM becomes _more_ normalized in the datacenter this is where its at.
