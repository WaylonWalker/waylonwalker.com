This is the end of the long winter break and time to get back to the normal
flow of life.  It's been a great 2 weeks off.  I was able to spend a lot of
quality time with the kids and get a lot of side project work done.  Markata
has come so far, and has made releasing new posts so much easier.

It's a good time to get a reset and remember what is most important, and not
let work me stressed out.  It's always going to be there and stressing over it
is not going to make much change to it.  We hae a ton of things going on in our
life that requires my attention, and thats ok.  This is why I am on such a
flexible work schedule.  There are times to push and really make a lot of
progress, and times to focus on helping family with their needs.
