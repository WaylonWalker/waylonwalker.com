I do much of my work from tmux, I love it so much that I want to setup some
functionality that puts me in tmux even if I didn't ask for it.


## Bash Function

Bash function to check if the shell is in a tmux session.

``` bash
in_tmux () {
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ]; then
    return 0
  else
    return 1
  fi
  }
```

## Using the bash function

I often open up vim to do some quite edits, but before I know it I have several
splits open and I need access to another shell utility, but I forgot to start
in tmux.  This function makes sure tht I start in tmux everytime.

Using `if_tmux` to ensure vim is opened in tmux.

``` bash
vim () {
  in_tmux \
    && nvim \
    || bash -c "\
    tmux new-session -d;\
    tmux send-keys nvim Space +GFiles C-m;\
    tmux -2 attach-session -d;
    "
  }
```


I am not quite sure if this is proper use of the `&&` and `||`, let me know if
you have a better way to do one thing if `in_tmux` returns true and another if
it returns faslse.
