description: I always struggle to find a good reference of ascii characters.  This
  is a compilation of my most wanted ascii characters.

---
When creating cli's I often want some nice full-width character.  I find it tough to find them, and when I do half the time it is an image or something that cannot be copied 👿.

I rarely get very complex with my semi-manual ASCII art.  I can do 98% of what I need with bars and corners.  Using some simple full-width characters can really give your cli a nice clean look.

## Example

I'd say 50% of what I need is just a full-width horizontal bar to give some visual flair or separation.

As I was putting this together I stumbled accross a good site to find ascii characters and copy them.
