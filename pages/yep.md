# /yep

Things I agree with, use, recommend, or will do.

## Tools I Actually Use

**Terminal & Shell**

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (without oh-my-zsh - [I removed it for speed](/blog/supercharge-zsh-startup))
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal
- [starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for session management

**Editors**

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - IDEs are too slow for my workflow
- vim keybindings everywhere

**Window Management**

- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) tiling window manager

**Python Stack**

- [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) over os.path - "it's amazing"
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks (black, mypy, isort, flake8)
- [ipython](https://ipython.org/) with `%autoreload`, `%debug`, `?` for docs
- [Kedro](https://kedro.org/) for data pipelines
- [Markata](/blog/markata) - my DIY static site generator

**Frontend**

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - convinced by @theprimeagen, love the tiny output
- Though I don't love needing npm to install it

**Infrastructure**

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - simple, commits to open source
- Self-hosted [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) in my basement - "Hell Yeah Brother"
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/), [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/), [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/)
- GitOps workflows

**Productivity**

- [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) (now TinaCMS) for git-based CMS
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) (Chrome extensions)

## Approaches I Believe In

**DIY Ethic**

- Build it yourself when you can
- Self-host what matters
- Own your content and platform
- "I love having a Kubernetes cluster in my basement"

**Authenticity**

- "I create this blog with one person in mind, me"
- Write honestly about failures and frustrations
- Don't pretend to know everything
- Under-funded, over-dreamed, barely documented - that's fine

**Simplicity**

- Fast startup times matter (shell, apps, everything)
- Single-purpose tools over monolithic suites
- Terminal-first workflows
- "Treat yourself better" - learn hotkeys, skip command palettes

**Open Source**

- FOSS over proprietary when possible
- Repairable, understandable systems
- Contributing back to communities

## When to Vibe Code

I'll vibe code for:

- Prototypes and proofs of concept
- Throwaway scripts
- Learning experiments
- When the tools are NOT better than me

But I'll be late to let agents touch production code.

## Hardware I Like

- Mechanical keyboards (I 3D print my own keycaps)
- Tinkering, building, making things physical

## What I'm Into

- [Gaming with family](/blog/dst-session-one) (Don't Starve Together)
- Daily [gratitude practice](/gratitude)
- Learning in public
- Sharing TILs and hot tips
