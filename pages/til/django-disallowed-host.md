I am continuing my journey into django, but today I am not at my workstation. I
am ssh'd in remotely from a chromebook.  I am fully outside of my network, so I
can't access it by localhost, or it's ip.  I do have cloudflared tunnel
installed and dns setup to a `localhost.waylonwalker.com`.

## Settings

I found this in `settings.py` and yolo, it worked first try.  I am in from my
remote location, and even have auth taken care of thanks to cloudflare.  I am
really hoping to learn how to setup my own auth with django as this is one of
the things that I could really use in my toolbelt.

``` python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost.waylonwalker.com']
```
