#### Community

I know that I am not the most social person that is ready to talk to everyone
in the room about anything. I am still grateful for the communities that I am a
part of. Without our group of friends we would not be able to make it through
all of the medical issues that we have had throughout the past few years.
Rhiannon and I are currently making great strides in our marriage and fincance
thanks to the great help from Scott and Ali. Without Rhiannon's medical
community she would not be here today. From getting her diagnosis to executing
their plans every step along the way has given her more years on her life.
Those years will be happily spent with the kids and I.
