Today Ayla got a new night time routine for her enema, its called a peristeen.
We have been looking forward to this step for awhile now.  The progress we have
made so far has been great.  She is gaining back a lot of independence and
confidence in herself, but the night time routine itself has been a sore spot.
It's been uncomfortable and causes cramping.  Rhiannon said the peristeen went
so well today at the appointment, that its going to be so much better.  We are
really just trying to do the best that we can for her, and want her to suceed
and go on with the most confidence she can.  We really do not want her scarred
from having accidents for all of her childhood.
