Markata is the static site generator that I created to build my website [[
about-this-site ]].  I built it for me and I enjoy using it.  I know everying
it can do and I can extend it to do more easily.  I have set it up for some
friends to also use it and am proud that it helps them publish their content.

It's a meme to create your own static site generator to make your website.  Yes
its funny, I don't recommend it if your not ready for the level of work that
comes with it, but at the end of the day it's very rewarding and a great way to
learn.
