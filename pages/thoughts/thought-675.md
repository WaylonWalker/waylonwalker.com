This looks like a very useful formatting tool to keep in the back of my mind.  I do a lot of python and our tool tends to be pre-commit, named after the git hook pre-commit.  It specifies a bunch of tools to run, you can run them in ci, manually, and opt into doing it before commit.  I like the simplicity of this one not needing a whole ecosystem, but rather just leveraging the cli commands from those tools.  This would probably be something that would get in the way of setup for new devs and not something I would throw on one project by itself, its another thing for everyone to figure out how to install and run on every platform, I'm sure its not hard, but being on python teams pre-commit just fits in.
