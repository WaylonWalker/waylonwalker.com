Is AI making us more productive yet, more faster yet?

## Non-code 

_probably not_

I've seen this question hitting all over the Internet lately, and often points
to people not writing code.  Copilot turns prompts into emails, emails back
into summaries that look a lot like prompts. I think there's a place for this,
making rambled thoughts sound more coherent, summarizing notes and meeting
minutes.  All good stuff but does it make us more productive, probably not by
an amount that you can put $ $ behind, unless you are reducing headcount.
_thats not what we are doing right???_

## Coding

_with chat, probably not_

When we talk about chatbots like gippity I think there's a benefit to having
someone with jr skills in everything to talk to, someone who can read all of
the docs in an instant to get you some code snippet that might have taken all
day to research and get right, but more productive, probably not.

## Agentic Coding

_maybe_

I've hit a stride with coding agents this year unlike I've hit before.  Its able to bang out huge swaths of code in a prompt, with a good enough spec/plan.  It absolutely churns out code.  The bottleneck quickly becomes UAT.

I definitely feel like I'm doing a lot.  There's a lot that's getting done that there's no way I could do alone, it would take a full team with heavy coordination.

## Am I more productive

I'm definitely doing more, there are more lines of code, more ideas flowing, more docs written, more notes taken, more bugs squashed, more features out.

In the sense of generating more $ $ for the stakeholder.  I really don't know that I'm there yet, everything feels so new and different that there's a bit of a learning curve to understand it all.  There's a pace and cadence to everything that may not be quite caught up yet.

It definitely feels like more is happening at a different pace that is hard to explain.

I'm sure there is a wide spectrum of folks out there from some generating millions of additional revenue in new greenfield industries, to those burning tokens and getting nothing in return.

With this SUPER AUTO COMPLETE engine it's easy to say we found a bug affecting a user, but rather than squashing that one and getting a release out quickly squash ALL related bugs that a user might find in this category, it only takes a few more keystrokes right??

Right now it feels like a lot is happening but its hard to sus out the real productivity from the noise.
