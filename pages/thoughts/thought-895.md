I really like a good link blog, it's the old timers version of a reaction video.  It gives me new posts to discover from other writers, and gives additional perspectives from ones I trust enough to add to my RSS.

> It’s nice to have a place where I can jot down a few notes, fire off my reaction, and nobody can respond to it lol. At least, not in any easy, friction-less way. You’d have to go out of your way to read my commentary, find my contact info, and fire off a message (critiquing or praising). That’s how I like it. Cuts through the noise.

Ditto Jim.  I've oddly found mine more useful to search than blog posts, zettlekaten, notes, whatever you want to call them.  For me writing something down makes it more concrete in my brain that I'm less likely to need to go reference, but I often need to re read or references posts from others, this is where [[ thoughts ]] comes in handy for me 

Like Jim I have a bunch of [[ feeds ]] you can subscribe to if you want some or all of my stuff, but I aggregate everything to the same root site.

!!! note

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
    about someone else's content online #thoughts
