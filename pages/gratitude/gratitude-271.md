Today was the first sip of coffee that I have had in nearly a week.  I am
grateful to be nearly back to myself, and feeling better.  I am grateful for
the ability to get back to work after a day off followed by a holiday weekend
nursing this illness.  I am hopeful that it does not hit anyone else in the
house that hard.
