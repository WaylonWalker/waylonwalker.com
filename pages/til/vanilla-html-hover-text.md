I needed to display some hover text in a web app that I am using tailwind and
jinja on.  It has no js, and no build other than the tailwind. I want this to
remain <span style='cursor: help; color:yellow;' title='respective to the
python developer I am and the team it is used for'>simple</span>. Turns out
that you can use a span with a title attribute to get hover text in
HTML.
