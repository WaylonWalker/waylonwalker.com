title: My First Agentic Workflow

In early 2026 I'm trying to lean more in to agentic workflows.  The tools are
not only better than they were a year ago, but available to me now unlike they
were 6 months ago.

## What I'm using

At home I'm using opencode, the tooling here is fantastic.  LSP incide of these
things is incredible, mcp is fine when its needed.  The free models it gives
you are impressively good for free models, but they are still not the big
models from the big providers.  I'm using what work gives me, they give me a
tool with access to good models, the models are great, the tools kinda suck.
I'm being vaugue here because I dont share real work details.

## Skepticism

I've been skeptical the whole way, I see ai being a very useful tool.  I remain
[[ techbrophobic ]].  It's better than the non believers will tell you, and no
where near as good as the hype bros will tell you.  The industry is shitty and
doing shitty things, I'm not here to change this, I'm here to do my thing and
try to get better.

## Software Engineering is not gone

What I'm feeling is that agentic workflows with llms are not going to replace
Software Engineering, I'm with Simon Willison holding out hope that it will
actually enable more companies to have needs and expand the industry.  I really
see where these workflows allow us to see the forest for the trees and work at
a higher level than we otherwise would be able to.
