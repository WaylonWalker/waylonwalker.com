> This is a really amazing documentary of argocd.  I got into k8s pretty late in the game.  Which is pretty typical for me.  As I went to use k8s for the first time i was using workflows, then cd.  both of these tools had a level of polish that made them seem like they had been there forever and not quite as young as they actually are.

I thought it was interesting how they focused on how the name must be two syllables or less, start with a or b, logo needs to be cutesy funny and recognizable seemed interesting, but puts them at the top of lists and makes them look like they've been there forever.
