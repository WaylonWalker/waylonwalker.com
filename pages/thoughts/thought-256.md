![[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space]]

html can preserve newline `\n` characters by styling an element with `white-space: pre-wrap;`

> pre-wrap
    Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are broken at newline characters, at <br>, and as necessary to fill line boxes.
