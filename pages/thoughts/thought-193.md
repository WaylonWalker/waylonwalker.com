> I just learned that if you can exec into the container running minecraft with the itzg/minecraft container you can run `rcon-cli` to get command access to the server.  You need to set the `RCON_PASSWORD` if you want to access rcon remotely, but if you have not already done this and have access to the server you can just run `rcon-cli` when you are in.
