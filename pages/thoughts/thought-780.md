A great alternative to tailwind colors that has everything defined in one colors file for only 0.3kb.  it feels well worth the weight if you are trying to skip a build step or avoid npm/node.  It has even more colors than tailwind.  I appreciate that there is a grey palette that is fully desaturated.
