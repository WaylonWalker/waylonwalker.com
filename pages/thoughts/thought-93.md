> Use prettier to format all files in a directory.  By default prettier does not write, it just echos out the format that it would do.  Give it the `--write` and it will write the changes to the files.

``` bash
prettier --write .
```

I just used this on my thoughts repo.

``` bash
prettier --write templates
```
