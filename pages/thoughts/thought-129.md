Wincent (Greg Hurrel) has a pretty solid and fast zshrc.  I recently grabbed his completion section and it seems to be working better than whatever I had.

zsh completion snippet


``` bash
#
# Completion
#

fpath=($HOME/.zsh/completions $fpath)

autoload -U compinit
compinit -u

# Make completion:
# - Try exact (case-sensitive) match first.
# - Then fall back to case-insensitive.
# - Accept abbreviations after . or _ or - (ie. f.b -> foo.bar).
# - Substring complete (ie. bar -> foobar).
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' '+m:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}' '+m:{[:upper:]}={[:lower:]}' '+m:{_-}={-_}' 'r:|[._-]=* r:|=*' 'l:|=* r:|=*'

# Colorize completions using default `ls` colors.
zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors ''

# Allow completion of ..<Tab> to ../ and beyond.
zstyle -e ':completion:*' special-dirs '[[ $PREFIX = (../)#(..) ]] && reply=(..)'

# $CDPATH is overpowered (can allow us to jump to 100s of directories) so tends
# to dominate completion; exclude path-directories from the tag-order so that
# they will only be used as a fallback if no completions are found.
zstyle ':completion:*:complete:(cd|pushd):*' tag-order 'local-directories named-directories'

# Categorize completion suggestions with headings:
zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''
zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format %F{default}%B%{$__WINCENT[ITALIC_ON]%}--- %d ---%{$__WINCENT[ITALIC_OFF]%}%b%f

# Enable keyboard navigation of completions in menu
# (not just tab/shift-tab but cursor keys as well):
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
```
