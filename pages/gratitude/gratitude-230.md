Today I got my work notes ironed out and working really well.  For some reason
a lot of the ideas of  zettelkasten really came through as I started building it
out.  In doing so I needed an inlinks system setup like obsidian, it was tricky
to layer into markata, but I got it working and am excited to bring that work
over here.  It's been a long time coming to actually have a good system that is
not tied to a OneDrive, or notes.  Markdown has become so natural to me over
the last 9 years running this blog, I don't know why I have not done it sooner.
