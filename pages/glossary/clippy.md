Clippy is a virtual office assistant from Microsoft, shipped from office 97 to
office 2003.  It was used to help train people how to use the software that was
becoming commonplace at the time.  Before this era most people probably never
had a reason to touch a computer.

As AI assistants are taking over everything in 2025, Clippy is standing as a
mascot of a better time.  Was Clippy perfect no.  Could you turn him off, yes.
Did he send your data to back to M$, no.  Did he try to sell you
something that you didn't ask for, no.  Did he try to up charge you for
something you already own, no.  Clippy just wanted to help, that's all he knew,
that's all that he was designed to do.  There was no malicious intent in Clippy.

Here is a quote from [Louis Rossmann](https://youtu.be/3NyUgv6dpJc?si=-M_mnWyqvGkpmEVI&t=893)

> [Clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) didn't sick an
> virtual dog on you that followed you everywhere you went, logged your
> personal communications, and reported them to the police, and to the guys
> that wanted to protect the children, Clippy just wanted to help, Clippy
> protected the children too, while protecting their privacy.
