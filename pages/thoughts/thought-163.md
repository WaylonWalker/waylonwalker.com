Nice take by [@t3dotgg](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg).   Some of the old patterns that go deep into webdev, MVC, separation of concerns, REST, are things we are told to believe on day one,  thrown so many things, no mental bandwidth, or experience to form our own opinions we must take them as fact.  Rarely do we take these facts and revisit them with our new understandings years later.
