FastAPI is a modern and efficient web framework for Python, built on top of the
Starlette web framework, and pydantic for data validation and serialization.

## From the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
* Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
* Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## Mentioned in [2025 Stack Overflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology/#1-web-frameworks-and-technologies)

The +5 point increase for FastAPI is one of the most significant shifts in the
web framework space. This signals a strong trend towards using Python for
building performant APIs and reflects the overall strength of the Python
ecosystem.
