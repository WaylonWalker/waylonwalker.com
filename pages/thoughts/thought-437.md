> I tried this fix on my secretlabs chair, but unfortunately it did nothing for me.  Mine ended up being an issue in the tilt mechanism and not the hydraulic piston.  I greased the crap out of it, it can only help the longevity.  I did notice that the two washers on either side of my bearing were quite worn in.
