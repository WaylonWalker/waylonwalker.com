hyprland does not load its plugins by default, I don't see anything in the
docs, but it appears that you need to `exec-once = hyprpm reload` to reload all
enabled plugins on startup.

## Markata Glossary

Worked on my glossary ui and how it works with markata.  I think I finally got
something that autodetects glossary terms and swaps them with a hoverable
element that displays the definition.  getting the definition to remain on the
screen at all times and not fall of when the term is on one side of the page or
another was quite tricky.
