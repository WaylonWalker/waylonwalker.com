I'm a bit down today, these fall allergies are running through my nasal cavity
like sandpaper and dragging my energy down.  I'm grateful to have the support
that I do to take the time to rest.  I'm grateful for everyone around me to
give me some time, grace, and space.  We modify play time with the kids a bit
so that its not so energetic.
