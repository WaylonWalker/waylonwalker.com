I just heard someone drop the this term and it kinda fits a lot of shit on the
internet right now.  Arguing that its OK to question AI, its OK to like it, its
OK to question if it needs to be in every goddamn thing we do, question its
morality on training and the slop being pushed at us all the time.

> I'm not Technophobic I'm Techbrophobic

I heard this and it kinda hit with a lot of things that I've resonated with
lately.  Tech bros of today have been compared to Steve Jobs in a lot of ways.
Whether its style or the way he was so good at marketing, but this feels
different.  When Jobs launched the iPhone as this next great thing, He fucking
made the thing.  

No broken promises of being sold something with hopes that it
will do more tomorrow.  

No pushing around insane amounts of money with the hope
to become profitable years down the line.  

No fear pushing that if you are not
doing X today your business will be dead in 6 months.  

Giving us the promise that it was about to create an entire industry of careers
through building software that brought us real value, real entertainment, Not
the promise of that.

This tech made it easier to do the mundane, no longer carrying out dated maps
in your glove box, everyone now has a flashlight, a calculator, a camera, a way
to video call your mom.

I'm not a complete Luddite, I see value in being able to lean on AI for
generating code, asking questions, helping change the tone of your messages.

There are so many issues with AI currently even looking past the stolen works,
copyright, and power consumption.  The messaging does not pass the vibe check.
High up folks are getting the impression that they can remove humans from the
workforce.  Deploy the same features with fewer headcount.  It's doing our art,
writing our code, communicating with our colleagues.  It's not doing protein
folding and cancer research.  No matter how many promises we get its not
driving our vehicles.

I do believe there is a world in which it makes us more efficient.  It fills in
the gaps of our knowledge.  It helps us learn.  It helps solve complex
problems.  It allows humans to flourish and create things they never could
have.
