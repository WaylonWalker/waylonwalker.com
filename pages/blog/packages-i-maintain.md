## Markata

I open sourced the static site framework that I use to build
[my-blog](https://waylonwalker.com/) among other side projects. It's a plugins
all the way down static site generator, that makes me happy to use.

## Repos used to build this blog

[my-blog](https://waylonwalker.com/) is built on a number of small repos. I
set it up this way so that creating content is fast and easy to do. I don't
have to worry about carrying around large images with my lightweight text
files just to make some posts.

## Kedro

I am a heavy user of the [kedro](https://kedro.org) framework, and a big
advocate for using some sort of DAG framework for your data pipelines. kedro
is built all in python which makes it easy for a python dev like me to extend,
run, maintain, and deploy.

## Neovim Plugins

I use vim for all of my text editing needs. It brings me joy to make any part
of it just a bit smoother. I have written a few plugins that help me achieve
that silky smooth workflow.
