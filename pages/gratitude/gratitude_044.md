#### Running

Over the course of the winter the kids and I have been creating trails through the woods behind our house.  It has been really fun.  The forrest is really thick with lots of small bits of brush,  a stream, logs and various old junk.  The kids have enjoyed having a place to get out of the house and stop around.  It has been a great outlet for us.

Recently I have started running on them.  I have been getting better and better.  I feel like I am starting to get back inot a bit of shape where I am not winded within minutes, but can at least make a few laps.  I find the trails really fun to run on, as I have always really struggled running on a track or even sidewalk.  I am always looking for something to make it more exciting.
