#### Persistence

Persistence is one of the great talents of my wife.  Today I am grateful for her persistence because she has the medicine that she needs for her MRI today.  Yesterday there was a struggle to get the doctors to get her prescription submitted to the pharmacy, and after calling many times she got it done within the last hour of the pharmacies operating hours.  Seriously who can get a prescription filled after 7:00PM!  I am just glad that she is able to have the medicine that she needs today.  It will make the procedure much easier.

#### Health


Seriously though without her persistence she would not even be here today.  Her persistence to get an accurate diagnosis was what kept her alive on more than one occasion.  There is something to be said for trusting your gut and standing behind what you believe in.
