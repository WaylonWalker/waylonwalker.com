> So it’s back to plan A: taking a year off. I plan on using this time to focus on my health–something I haven’t prioritized while working as a CEO / Founder of a startup.

Wish you the best Will, you have given us textual and rich, and from what I can tell left it in some great hands.

Go get em Will, write to your hearts desire, and resist the urge to make an SSG company this time.
