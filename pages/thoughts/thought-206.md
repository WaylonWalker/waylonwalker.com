Great example from Anthony showing how easy it is to practice building database orm models and playing with them in a repl.  This is good practice even if you are in  a big code base to be able to test and learn in a simplified code base that does not have a mountain of other code around atuh, permissions, security, and other complex things that come into real production code bases that might make it hard to focus on what you are trying to do.

!!! Note
   Anthony uses backref here, thats legacy, use back_populates on both parent and child.
