Animal well does not let you remap keys, and really doesn't even inform you
that it is keyboard compatible.  I had to play around and discover the keymap,
which can be a bit tricky on a 40% board.  This is what I found.

* wasd - move
* space - jump / a
* enter - interact / b
* x - throw
* c - inventory
* 1 - left item / rb
* 2 - open item menu / triangle
* 3 - right item / lb
