Stop babysitting your agents, treat them like a real team and they will reward
you.

Back in December I saw theo make a comment that code is now cheap, its the run
rate of models, He quoted a study, not sure that he fully even believed it, but
it claimed that the average developer after all meetings, training, emails,
planning and extra shit in their day averages out 10 well tested lines of code
per day.  Opus 3.5 made him 10k loc (lines of code) that day.

We have all agreed for decades that lines of code is not a proxy to
productivity or quality.  Often more code means more risk, more review, more
infrastructure.  This has become MUCH different.  Lines of code are still far
from any sort of good metric.  That aside, your agents are not doing 10k lines
with you babysitting them, and in fact its very likely that the product quality
is MUCH worse as you babysit them.

You need a tool for planning and tracking, otherwise you are playing babysitter
rather than Product Manager (PM).
