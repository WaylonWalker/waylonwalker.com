I just never quite understood why the word `just` can send people over the top. I
get it when you don't know someone, you don't have history with them, and they
come in saying you are doing something wrong.

If I've worked with someone for more than 6 months, we have established
patterns for problems, libraries we use, and they are deep in the weeds of
trying to fix something, I want to ask  "Why don't you just do the same thing
we do everywhere else?"

I don't need a snarky ass response, I don't need you to get bent out of shape
about it. I **am** communicating that I do not know the damn constraints to
this problem.  I am communicating I am ignorant to the pain you have suffered
trying to do something for days that I thought should be copy paste pr up in 10
minutes.

What I want to hear is "Well here's the story of why this particular one is
complex, and let me take you on my travels." or "I'm about there and don't have
time right now just understand that this is different, we can discuss later."

My _just_ should not cause you pain, it should **not** cause you to feel belittled,
If we have worked together for any amount of time and have respect for each
other, you should understand that this is not coming from a place of
belittlement, rather its an open door for you to explain why this thing is not
what it seems at surface level.

## Just use another library

Here Sam asks "Why don't you just use another library?", and Alex replies "If
it were that easy, I would have done it already."

Honestly this example is a little vague and non-specific.  On boarding a new
library to a team can be a big ask.  It becomes something that the team has to
integrate and depend on, and take on supply chain risk.  This example would be
better with something more specific, if the team often uses a mix of SQL,
pandas, and occasionally pulls out polars for bigger tasks, Sam  might
legitimately ask "why don't you just use <insert pandas, polars, SQL>".

This communicates that Sam see's the obvious we use polars when things get
tough, or we use SQL when data transfer gets too slow.

## You are not Dumb

I want to hear the story. In no way am I calling you dumb, in fact I'm probably
claiming ignorance to the problem at hand.  I see that you have a lot more time
invested than me and I'm offering help, not asking for snarky ass remarks back
**Alex**.

In fact take it as a sign that I am this comfortable with you and that you are
so far from dumb that I don't have to risk being taken out of context.

## Or maybe you are

Or maybe Sam is trying to belittle Alex here, if that's the case we need to
have a conversation and work some shit out or find somewhere else to be, Alex
should not be belittled like this because Sam is full of himself.

## Suggestions

The suggestions are _fine_, but they feel like they are asking me to hunt
around for the problem rather than you recognizing my ignorance to the issue,
and let Sam tell me "Why don't you just use another library?"

## Final Thoughts

In recognizing how much pain this causes others I do try to limit my use of
just, it comes out from time to time, though I try not to.  I try to remain
kind, humble, and helpful.  And typically in the first few weeks or months
interaction with new teams/people I kinda walk on eggshells for a bit.  I don't
know you or where you are, if I make it sound like you are dumb and turns out
that's what people think of you I'm gonna feel kinda bad.  Just understand that
not everyone is trying to attack you, communication via text is hard, give
folks a break before jumping them.

## Don't be an Ass

This post is not trying to say that you can freely belittle your team, go forth
and be the irritating guy on the team that comes off like a know it all.  I'm
saying when you are on the receiving end try not to take it with such offense
and as an opportunity to explain without the need to dance around the issue.
