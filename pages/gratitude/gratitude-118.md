What a day today was, we were really tossed into the home moving process
on all fronts.  We checked out a rental that is really close to where we
currently are.  It's quite a bit smaller, more expensive, and has no
backyard.  It does seem like it would not be a bad short term option
though.  Our current house was viewed by a potential buyer, this was
completely tossed on us last minute, throwing us in a complete scramble
to tidy up.  And finally we just started talking with a home mortgage
company about the possibility of purchasing a home.  It's all a lot.
This house has been good to us, and getting through the last year in
quarantine, but out time here is running short.  It's exciting, and I am
so grateful that we have some options.
