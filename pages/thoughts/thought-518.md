Really interesting way to generate a rules file for agentic workflows based on your current repo.  John uses gitingest here, looks like a fantastic tool, but probably not useful for most private repos.  I'm sure you can replicate the same thing in a private repo wtih a small amount of effort the few times you need to do it.  gitingest looks like a great way to pull in some extra context for some open source dependencies that you have though.
