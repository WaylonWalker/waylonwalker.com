Today I learned that its spelled "Rite of Passage", and is short for ritual.  Mac has so many of these things that are just different, but do not let you reconfigure them and you are stuck with it.  copy / paste I don't get, the 3 times I've touched a mac since I was a kid its frustrated me.  Is it lock in? or is it them actually thinking this is the right way and you all shall do as we say.
