What a busy morning today.  We got our sink unclogged, Dobby had a
follow up Vet apt, and a trainer apt.  So glad that our sink is finally
fixed and we did not end up with any bad kitchen floods in the process.
Well there was that time when I was taking out the old broken dishwasher
and it dumped all over on the way out, but it was quickly mopped up.
