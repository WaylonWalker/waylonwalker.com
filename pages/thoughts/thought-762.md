> I really enjoy David's Glossary, he has absolutely nailed it.  I'm working on one for myself that feels close but not quite.  I want to have a list of words that auto glossary to terms for me, maybe this is too much automation and I should just lean on wikilinks, i.e. [[ sick-wikilink-hover ]], they only take wrapping in brackets.   But like David mentions here its a lot of work to make sure they are right on all the older posts.  I think it needs to be done with js on my setup, I don't have no fancy wroker to modify html on the way out, I'm fully static right now, so i would need to do full rebuilds any time the glossary changes, i'm trying to cut down on the number of features that require full site rebuilds and potential cache issues.
