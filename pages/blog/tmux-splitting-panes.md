splitting panes is a core feature of tmux.  It allows us to split the terminal
vertically or horizontally into new panes.

``` bash
bind -n M-s split-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -n M-v split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind -n M-X kill-pane
```

> 🗒️ note that  '#{pane_current_path}'will keep the split in the same directory
> as it's parent, without this it will default to your home directory.
