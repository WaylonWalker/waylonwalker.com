title: Gratitude 100

---

It's Christmas eve and the love and excitement is in the air.  It's
definitely been a chaotic day with emotions going high and low.  Ayla
has been singing her heart out, she even recorded one on Mommy's phone
and sent it to me.  Wyatt and I hav play many rounds of Minecraft,
installed a crazy number of new mods, and got a few rounds of 0AD in.


Best of all we had a special supper, and enjoyed a movie all together,
that's right Wyatt, the king of not being able to stay put for 5 mintues
enjoyed at least half a movie with us before we cut out early to go
play.  I am so grateful that I have this time off to enjoy with them and
see them just so happy and joyful.

Merry Christmas Everyone.
