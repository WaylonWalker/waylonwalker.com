## Using c to change text

I have gone quite awhile without using ```c``` and instead using ```d```.  The reason that I started using ```c``` is because it automatically places you into insert mode.  This not only saves me one keystroke for commands such as ```diwi``` is now ```ciw```, but it also works with the repeat ```.``` command!!!  This is huge.  When refactoring a document I had been creating a macro to change one word to another, using ```c``` instead of ```d``` allows the use of the ```.``` rather than needing to create a macro.

## Case for vim

**Sublime/VSCode cannot**

* edit a macro register
* register
* quickfix
* gF
