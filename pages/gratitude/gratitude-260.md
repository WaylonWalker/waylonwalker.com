Happy Anniversary to us.  19 years together to this day, wow I feel old
thinking about that, those are old people numbers right there, and I'm proud of
it.  So far have we come from two young kids to having kids not that far off
from that same age.  We have it pretty great together, and do a pretty good job
tackling everything we do together, time to grab some cheesecake for
celebration.
