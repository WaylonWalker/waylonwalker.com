Slowly back into it.  After the longest break I have had from work
(other than shut downs) in quite awhile I am back at it.  It felt really
good to know that the team that I am building at work is becoming
capable of sustaining themsleves without me.  A few years ago this was
not the case.  We hired a bunch of people really fast and threw them all
into it without onboarding.  Since then we have taken the time to really
grow them into where they are, and have been much more careful about
onboarding new foks.  I am so proud of this team for being able to
sustain themselves all on their own.
