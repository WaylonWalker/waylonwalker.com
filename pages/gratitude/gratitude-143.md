BOOSTED x2.  Rhiannon is double boosted as of today.  She is so far handling it
like a champ.  I can tell it's having its effect on her, but the real effects
are going to come over the next few days.  I really think the timing is great,
she will have some time to recover before the move really starts to happen and
she will be fully boosted right as all the major stuff is happening, keeping
her as absolutely safe as possible.

Tonight is date night, super excited to chill and watch the race with her for
the night.  This season has been pretty exciting so far and its been really fun
to get back into it with her.
