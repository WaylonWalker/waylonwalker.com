I'm working on replacing my usage of google inline search apps with real apps,
these are ones that I create and host on my own homelab.  The first three that
I created are mostly chatgpt based, with a bit of hand edit after the fact,
uploaded to minio and become an app on my [k8s-pages](https://github.com/waylonwalker/k8s-pages) chart.
