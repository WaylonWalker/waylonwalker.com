> Kellan brings some interesting thoughts on where the internet is headed in 2024.  Interestingly I see myself headed in a similar direction.  Feeling like I know just enough to say fuck it and build my own platform for me to me me, from [thoughts](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com){.hoverlink} where I link and make thoughts on posts like this, to [reader](https://reader.waylonwalker.com){.hoverlink} which is my rss reader replacement that I wanted in 2013 when it was [killedbygoogle](https://killedbygoogle.com/){.hoverlink}

>  And particular with the collapse of the social spaces many of us grew up with, I feel called back to earlier forms of the Internet, like blogs, and in particular, starting a link blog.

Ai has really had quite the two sided effect since chatgpt launched and set the world ablaze.  Suddenly you can get any answer you want as a custom fit blog post for free without effort, thus killing the traffic to any of these sites.
