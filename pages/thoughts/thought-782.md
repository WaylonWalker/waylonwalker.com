> Woof, ai is sucking the soul from everything, being forced onto teachers who don't want or care about it and are simply sharing ai-slop to their kids without giving it much thought.  remember that it is [rude](https://distantprovince.by/posts/its-rude-to-show-ai-output-to-people/) to share ai-slop with others that you have not vetted, It's next level to turn this into teaching material for children who are forced into your classroom and have no choice about the matter, you should be ashamed.
