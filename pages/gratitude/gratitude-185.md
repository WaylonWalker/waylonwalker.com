Today we got out of the house for a walk around the neighborhood.  It
feels good to help everyone get back out and active.  I can't skate with
the kids yet, but they can still ride their scooters.  Rhiannon came
with us and I am very grateful, because Ayla was really struggling and
needed a whole parent to focus on her.
