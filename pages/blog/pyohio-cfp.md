## Idea to blog post in minutes - Shorter

Markata is a plugins all the way down static site generator, that covers all
the things you need to go from markdown to a blog site out of the box.  Since
it's plugins all the way down you can also rip out all the default plugins, and
do something completely different with the lifecycle.

Lets build a whole blog site in 5 minutes.

## Add Kedro to your Pandas Workflow - Short

Sometimes python scripts/notebooks take a long time to run, let kedro
automatically save your datasets so that you can maintain your production code
with ease.  Lets take a pipeline with an issue 30 minutes in and solve the
issue in 5 mintues.
