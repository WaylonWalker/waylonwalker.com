> This is such a cool idea, I tend to not use laptops at all because they are so uncomfortable I just wait till I'm back at my desk.  This solves two main issues I have with laptops, the posture to use them is shit, the keyboards that come on them is not what I want to use.  I've solved the latter with my own custom keyboard.
