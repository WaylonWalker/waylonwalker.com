It's Saturday, and round one of supercross is about to start.  I love this time
of year and am ready to enjoy some good racing.  I'm sad that Jet is out, but
from what I know there is a lot of guys coming in healthy.  A lot on new teams.

Had a lot of fun today with kids, we worked on painting, Dont Starve Together,
and DND.  I made some more keyboard progress.  I'm about to start printing out
a new one.  This one is supposed to be a clone of the last one with some issues
fixed.  I want two really good working ones that are clones of each other.
