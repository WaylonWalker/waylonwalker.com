> Chris Coyier had a small re-align on his site, some good nuggets in here.

> I like the idea of having a photo of myself prominently on the site, so you know who you’re dealing with here.

I really like this after thinking about it and I think I am going to make sure I get my face back on my posts.  I do have my 8bit style pixel art image of me that I use on social media, but no real picture.

>  I feel like a lot of people redesign their entire website when it’s time to update to the latest list of social networks and I’m no different. Once you touch it you gotta keep going.

I can totally relate to this, once you open the thing, you get the build tools greased up, and your confidence high that re-deploying isn't going to mess something up, I tend to start digging in to other things.
