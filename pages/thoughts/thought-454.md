I really like this idea of keeping a set up contacts in a markdown repo, and being able to wikilink them to different tickets / meetings and what not.  I'm imagining the graph you can build, it feels quite interesting.  Even more relevant as we see things like teams rolling out retention limits to messages.


Here is Cassidy's format, I like it but I'm probably not going to track the birthday of most people I work with, thats just not the relationship I tend to have with work friends.  It might be a midwest or non tech thing, but I am not even aware if any of my co-workers have social media, and I assume that if they did it would not include anything work related but more football and other sports.
