> I fully believe in our right to repair, ewaste reduction, and bringing a second life to still good hardware that is not up for it's originally intended purpose.  This is a sick console like experience you can strap to the back of a tv, throw in your back to take on a trip, or leave stuffed in your vehicle to game in the backseat.  Sucks that it cant do 4k, but I've used mine on large screens, and it does quite well for a lot of games, maybe not AAA, but the cartoony multplayer games I play with my kids do quite well.
