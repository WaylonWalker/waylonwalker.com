Tonight was the fall showcase for Ayla, a culmination of her work from this
falls acting and singing classes.  It was amazing to see how well she is doing.
She loves it.  She really practiced hard and knew her stuff.  She was in step,
in line, didn't miss a beat.

It's always heartwarming to see Rhiannon's name on the handouts for set build.
I wasn't on there this time as I was with Wyatt during all the builds this time
around.  It's great to see that through everything we go through Ayla still has
a solid support group for her activities.
