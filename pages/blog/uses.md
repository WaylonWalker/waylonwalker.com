This is a listing of all the things that I use on a daily basis to build data
pipelines, lead my team, and build this website.


## Installation

Everything installed on my machines is done through ansible-playbooks.  It's
been a long transformation to get here, but its so satisfying to boot a brand
new system, run a single command a have every single thing cofigured exactly to
my liking.


``` bash
# GET is available by default on Ubuntu
GET waylonwalker.com/bootstrap | bash

# For debian based systems without GET by default
sudo apt install curl
curl -F https://waylonwalker.com/bootstrap | bash
```

## OS

I run Ubuntu, it works well for me without too much fuss.  For me the
distribution does not really matter too much, I'm more interested in what's
inside.

## Window Manager

I use awesome wm.  Awesome is a tiling window manager that alows me to navigate
through 9 workspaces (technically called tags in awesomewm). I can script out
certain applications to open in a certain tag, move it to different tags, and
join tags super easy.  I really dont see myself going back to a floating window
manager where you have to place all your windows with the mouse by hand.  This
is probably one of the biggest selling points for me to move to a Linux
desktop.

## Terminal

### gnome-terminal

For the longest time I just used
[gnome-terminal](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/).  It
works, for the most part it gets out of the way and lets me do what I want.  I
just want a terminal that runs tmux properly, runs without titltbars or
scrollbars, and lets me theme it without much effort.

### kitty

[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is my main terminal, these days, it's
nice, its easy to configure how I want it, but most of its fancier features do
not work inside of tmux.  It does render incredibly fast, If I accidently cat
out a massive file, it typically just handles it, compared to other terminals
that will be printing for 30s or so.

### Windows Terminal

When I am on a windows terminal I use the _new_
[Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).  It's a massive improvement
over any other terminal that I have ever tired on windows.  Text looks good,
the built in themese look good, I use the One-Half-Dark Theme, and the built in
Cascadia Code font.  Also things like system clipboards, copy, and paste just
seem to work better, and integrate well with wsl.

## Shell

The shell is the interpreter that interprets the commands that you send to it
from the command line, unlike the terminal that displays the text.

### zsh

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my shell of choice.  I don't run
oh-my-zsh, I just need a few plugins for things like
[autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
[syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
[history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).
