Today has gone backwards in this cough, is it the cold air rolling in.  The cough is kicking back in.  The kids are home from the cold weather, we have a feels like of -15 with full sun and no wind.  It's been a pretty good day with them so far, mostly working and doing a thing or two here and there.

Today I am grateful for our warm house, reliable vehicles that can brave the cold, and the ability to have work from home day.
