#### My Parter

Last night stared like any other night. Put the kids to bed, hang out with my Beautiful wife for a while, off to sleep, then Wyatt comes in at the wee hours of the morning ready to start his day.  The only difference last night was that it was not the wee hours of the day, it was **11:30 PM**.  He was wired and ready to go as if he slept the whole night through.  I am very grateful that I was able to tag team the situation with Rhiannon, as he did not go back to sleep.  We were both able to get some rest through the night.  It may not have been the best, but we were able to make the best out of a tough situation.  In the Morning we had to take the van into the repair shop, and on the way home we were able to discuss some solutions to the problem when it happens in the future.  Rhiannon was able to get the ball rolling with the pediatrician to see their recommendations.  Man I love her, long before I would have even thought to go that route she had already sent the message out.
