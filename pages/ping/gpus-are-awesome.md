GPU's are awesome.  I just added gpu support to my bambu-studio distrobox and
its flying!  On my wayland based system the native package has never worked,
(arch or bazzite), but running in a distrobox does. Outside of distrobox the 3d
rendering canvas is black, no output.  It used to work fine without gpu
support, was snappy enough, complex models were a bit sluggish, but fine.
Lately something happened and simple models bring it to its knees.  It got
unusable!
