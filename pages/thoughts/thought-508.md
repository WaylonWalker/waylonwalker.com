I can say I had the same kind of feelings when I first saw something called "Own Your Web" being run in Buttondown.  I totally get it.  It takes time and effort to build your own stuff, email sending is hard, not done right ends you in the spam folder.  There is something about the name though that I think needs to set an example and self host as much as it possibly can.  

The changelog has covered this several times, do they need to go to the crazy lengths they do to run their site, no probably not, but it keeps them in the loop.  They are using the tech they talk about in a very real and production critical way to run the show.

Cant wait to see more from ownyourweb.site
