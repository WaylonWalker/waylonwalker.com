This week has been quite productive, I've been riding the lightning in a bottle
of inspiration and knocking out a project that I did not think I would get to
for months, but a small part was needed sooner and its turning out great.  So
grateful to be able to ride the wave of inspiration and not be stuck to the
jira grindstone, held to the rigors of what PM thinks is best.  In this
project I'm full fucking stack, front end, back end, PM, jira ticket zarr.
It has its ups and downs, and right now it feels up.
