Chill rainy Sunday.  Made progress on getting the garage usable again, hung big
bikes on the wall, tore down a temporary table/saw horses, and finally got to
skate in there a little bit.  Had a big incident with the Freezer, we are all
pretty upset it's no one persons fault, any one of us could have caught it at
some point. Wyatt and I got back into factorio, super fun, but hard to put down.
