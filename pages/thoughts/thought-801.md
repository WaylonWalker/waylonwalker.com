This is a crazy theory I did not realize was out there, but damn power just keeps costing more and more.  She does not mention it here, but there are many sources of power for the grid that cost vastly different amounts to produce, generally "clean energy" solutions are harder and more expensive to bring online and don't just turn on and off at the flick of a switch.  Anyways, how are the power companies divying this power out to users, do some get preferred rates or supply?  My rates just went up for the summer period "temporarily".  Our infrastructure is aging hard to upgrade and needs something done to it.  Who's really going to pay for it, these AI companies are throwing big numbers but do they have any real money?  Do they have any real revenue after building out massive data centers filling them with the most expensive hardware?  These guys are burning cash like crazy.
