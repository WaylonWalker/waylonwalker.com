Today started off good, but the coughing is kicking in this afternoon, its a
bit rough.  Glad that the energy is coming back more and more, but dang some of
the coughing fits are rough.  I have all of the parts of my next keyboard
printed and its feeling good.  The one that I'm on right now feels great, but
this one is really going to feel nice.  It was printed strong n slow, and will
be sanded down smooth.  Its going to take awhile but will be worth it, its
going to last.  

Yesterday I got the flu shot on top of already having the flu, not sure how
they double in, but woof last night I was tired, got to sleep early and slept
hard.  I woke up in quite a daze a few times.

Today after work I wrapped up my latest [[ shots/heringbone-fingerboard ]], and
it turned out fantastic.  I flooded the bottom with uv resin and let it level
out, then hit it with my light for awhile before borrowing Rhiannons nail light
which worked fantastic to cure it.
