I don't know if you know this, but the web is a beautiful platform that allows
you the freedom to create things and put them out there.  Its not tied to four
major platforms.  You don't have to post your thoughts, ideas, and apps to a
platform, you can just make it.  This is a beautiful thing that seems to have
been forgotten.  I was inspired this morning from @scotthanselman's
[tinytooltown](https://www.tinytooltown.com/).  Looking through all of the tiny
tools that people have built for themself, as personal software, not answering
to anyone but themself, it was inspiring.
