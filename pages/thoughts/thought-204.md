How do you pronounce URL, is it U.R.L or Earle?  I'm about 50/50, mostly when I am in a hurry I use Earle as it is one syllable and easy to say.  I picked this up from MPJ of fun fun function, who took over Dev Tips.  In this episide Jim uses Earle and they make fun of him.  If it's good enough for Jim, I am done with my 50/50 and I'm going all in on Earle.

Episode also included a fastinating corrdinated attack that used Ars Technica profile photos communicate directions for the next attack via query parameters in the image url.
