Tonight we had a bit of a small boys night.   I helped Rhiannon wrap up some signs for the theater and take them down, Ayla and her stayed back a little longer and I went home to cook supper with Wyatt.  He wanted to do biscuits and gravy, not something we have that often a bit surprised he picked it, but so grateful that he ate it.  No matter how many times he says he likes a meal , and wants to help out with it, he still eats peanut butter sandwiches.  We ate together while watching Unnecesary Inventions, then went up to build https://30s.wyattbubbylee.com.

> Wyatt wanted to make some seasoned biscuits, I allowed one seasoned one, and he chose cinnamon. It actually did not turn out too bad, probably would not do again with exactly dry cinnamon thrown on a frozen biscuit, but it worked.  It was adjacent to a cinnamon role.
