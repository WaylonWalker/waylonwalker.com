I logged into a brand new hardcore world. I was welcomed by a great Acacia
biome spawn full of resources. I quickly cut my first tree, crafted an axe and
set out to find my first sheep. I was able to find enough sheep for a bed,
several cows and pigs.

I crafted a set of wooden tools, and farmed out a wheat farm till my wooden
hoed died at the shore of a nearby stream. I found a small stone outcropping
in the side of a hill and harvested nearly a full stack of cobblestone from my
first wooden pick.

I ended the first day by sleeping in my bed safe from mobs.
