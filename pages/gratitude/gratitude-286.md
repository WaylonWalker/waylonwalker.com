Lately there's been a lot of news of layoffs.  A lot of companies trying to replace with ai, a lot of restructuring for ai evolution, restructuring for lower consumption of American made, lower shipping rates.  This all makes me very grateful that I still have a job.  A great one.  One that I am good at and do well.  This year we are doing RTO.  As much as I hate it, we are doing it because we are a face to face company.  It's pretty much this is how we are like it or find somewhere else.  As much as I don't like the edge cases not being considered here and seeing what's happening to a select few of my colleagues it feels good in this replace people with ai economy we are in to have a place that appreciates you.  It gives me confidence that I will continue to have a place here for a long time coming.  It's a very mixed bag of emotions.  A lot of them are appreciating that I still have a great job that I love with people I enjoy working with.
