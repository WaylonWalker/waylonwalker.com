#### Positivity

There is no substitute for a positive personality.  I am very grateful to have a super positive subset of folks that I work with every day, it really helps to cancel out the negative ones.   I really like what Gary V. says about surrounding yourself with positive people, Keep  only those who are positive arounnd you and let the rest go.  I really struggle to completely shut out anyone from my life, but I do try to focus my interactions to those who are positive and uplifting.  I will give nearly anyone who asks for help in a nice positive way 15mins - 1hr.  Those who come and demand help with negativity are hard to give that time to.  I do not seek them out for help, feedback, or to check in on them.  Keep the positive ones close to you.

As this one is about positivity I find it odd that it went in a direction about negative folks and was on the edge of not really being a gratitude post.  I guess thats what happens in a short/timed freeflow sometimes.
