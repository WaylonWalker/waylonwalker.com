> Dang strong stance that tmux and zellij should not exist.  I really do get his point though.  Theres a good number of terminal features I often miss out on because I run tmux.  Its an app that runs apps, and doesn't let all of the signals back to the host.  But its fantastic at what it does, and brings so much to the table that the little bit of downside it brings is well worth it to me.  The other thing missing in this discussion is that I can take my hotkeys and session workflow to any machine just by running tmux.  I do not need to run a certain terminal, or install it headlessly on a server to get special features just for it.
