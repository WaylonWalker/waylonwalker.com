Red Hat has donated the whole open alternative to docker to the CNCF, the hosts weigh in with thier opinions all being pretty positive as they seem to be a legitimate donation and not dumping crap on open source.

* podman
* podman-desktop
* buildah
* compose-fs
* podman
* bootc
* scopio

Personally I've been running podman exclusively at home since switching to Bazzite in August.  I'd like to use buildah in ci. I gave it a try, but was unable to swap out my use of kaniko for buildah, I will get there, but it was not quite as drop in as I wanted.
