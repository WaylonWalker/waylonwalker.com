> Silksong DLC announcement already, we waited 8 years for the game, and are getting DLC's months after launch.  Dudes I haven't even finished the game get, maybe not even half way.  It's amazing.  Its amazing that these three make such a kick ass game with great art, story, voice, gameplay, and now drop a free dlc in 2026.
