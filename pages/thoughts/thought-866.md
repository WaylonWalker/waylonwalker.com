> Are we cooked?  Are we?  Yes the consumers are cooked there are no more affordable cars with basic shit that you need to go point a to point b.  Ford make us cars we can afford and you won't be cooked by this dumb shit.  If you can market it?  

Most people don't care what sticker price is and only the monthly payment.  This is why we are cooked.  We stopped caring that these things cost way too much.  I'm probably in a small minority that just want an affordable reliable vehicle and could care less about features past climate control.  I don't use them.  My phone has maps and music I don't need a screen in my vehicle for anything.
