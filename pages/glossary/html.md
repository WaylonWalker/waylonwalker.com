HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create
and design documents on the World Wide Web. It structures web content by
defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other
multimedia components. HTML uses a system of tags to denote different types of
content and their relationships, allowing browsers to render the content
appropriately for users. It is a fundamental technology alongside CSS
(Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript that enables the creation of
interactive and visually appealing web pages.
