> I like reading about old hardware and how to keep it running, sending shit out to e-waste after barely using it for a year makes my skin crawl.  I find it interesting how most of these resurrections start with a linux build, and the author giving in and going for linux for the first time and enjoying being able to use something they thought was useless for real work.  

That being said I have weird thoughts similar to this guy about being able to take a machine and write a novel somewhere off in the distance, but any time I try to do real work form any laptop these days the ergonomics become so unappealing that I tend to just not do anything away from my desk.  Theres something that sounds so great about opening vim on old hardware that could last for hours, sip on coffee and write away, but it never works out like that in practice.
