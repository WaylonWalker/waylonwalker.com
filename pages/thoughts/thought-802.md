> Damn this VAnessa is hitting my feed with hard topics, I'm not sure whether to subscribe or to block.  These top websites only feel worse every day, when I post on twitter and I get 4 likes by accounts that were created 5 minutes ago with racy profile pics it feels obvious.  I wonder how larger accounts deal with it.  Now that llms have made making these bots mimic humans easy It really makes you want out.  I've really become a curmudgeon and leaning on rss over the past year, I dont like it, but idk what to do.
