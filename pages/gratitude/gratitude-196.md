15 years. It's been a fantastic 15 year journey that I could have never
imagined.  I never would have guessed half of our journey that we have been on,
but id say we were half right from teh start.  Right from the start we both
knew that we had found the other person that we wanted to spend the rest of our
life with.  We wanted to go to the same college, have two wonderful kids, and a
house.  We could have told you many of these big picture items from very early
on, but the journey that it took to get here has been exciting.  It's been full
of highs and lows, but nothing I would have ever traded for the world.
