Hatch be flyin.

This new release of hatch includes support for the new package installer `uv` which is just mind blowing fast compared to anything else we have in python right now.

``` toml
[tool.hatch.envs.default]
installer = "uv"
```

The other features are cool too, check them out.  I'll probably be using the test runner, but I've been waiting for the uv support since uv launched.
