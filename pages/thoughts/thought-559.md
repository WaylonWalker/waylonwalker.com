> Interesting thoughts here on blog post titles, do we need them?  They are so ingrained into everything.

It makes me think about markata.dev.  I don't require you to add any meta data to your post, you don't need a title at all, but you do have to name a markdown file, and this does end up being your title if you don't set one.

> Titles are a lot of pressure! I think there is a reason that the big text-based social networking sites (Mastodon, X, Facebook, Threads, LinkedIn, Bluesky, etc.) don’t have titles. Especially for short posts, the title just isn’t necessary. Just say the thing.

Interesting observation what rss readers do without one.

>My own favorite[rss reader], Feedbin, shows the author of the post as the title if it’s missing. Eh, not great not horrible.

Hilariously he puts a title on the OG image for the post.  I was interested in seeing what would happen in signal, it appears to be showing the author name as well.

Confirmed the page has no title

or does it?

It makes me wonder where Signal gets this title is it from the title block or the site_name meta data
