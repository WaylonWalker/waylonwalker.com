I saw this in @cassido's newsletter this week and had to give it a run.  I despise that there is no dark mode and it insists on burning my retinas 😤.  But really this is an absolute beate of a web based markdown editor, I love the command mode to press slash and it just pops out in this whimsical animation ready for me to pick what I want.
