One of the well worded shitty messages I've seen, good severance, help, timeline to cut off coms.

> we're not making this decision because we're in trouble. our business is strong. gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. but something has changed. we're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. and that's accelerating rapidly.

Much better than the get rid of people cause AI can do the work.  Honestly I feel this though.  I was just talking with some colleages how do we divvy work in the age of agents without just constantly walking on each other.  If each of us is now an architect who is managing teams of junior agents under us it feels MUCH different than before.

I'm far from working in a large software org like this and I'm feeling it.  I only imagine that it gets worse the more people that have to orchestrate around each other.

Appreciate the honesty and transparance, but man this sucks for those impacted and the job market right now.
