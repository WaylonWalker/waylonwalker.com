Today was mothers day, and it was one of the most chill mother's day we have
ever had.  We, maybe I should say I, did not go so wild with things.  Mom got
some handmade artwork, and easy afternoon, and a mothers day theme sidewalk
chaulk art.

At the end of the day we went to Hy Vee, and dang am I impressed with how well
Wyatt did.  Both did very well till the end, where Ayla really lost it when she
saw things that she thought that she really needed, but didn't.  It's so hard
when you have not been in a store for so long to get so see real things for
sale.

Anyways, Wyatt was fantastic.  I pushed mom in the wheel chair and he took the
cart.  He very calmly and maturely pushed the cart through the entire store,
and even filled it with all the things we needed, and nothing more.  Not once
did we have to remind him that we were there just for groceries.
