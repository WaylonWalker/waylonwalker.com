Crutches are gone, whoop whoop!  But dang this leg is weak.  It's crazy how
much strength you loose after 3 weeks of no weight bearing, but also impressive
to see how quickly it starts coming back.  After just half the day back on my
feet I am walking without crutches pretty well.

Wyatt has been so helpful lately it has been very impressive.  Since our big
meltdown night he has been ready to help without too much push back.  This has
been a huge relief and really helped get through the tail end of this stint on
crutches.
