Failed to [[ gpg-setup-for-kdewallet ]] correctly on hyprland, brave still
complains.  Maybe someday I'll figure it out and complete the post.

I installed hyprpm plugins.

Failed to fix Wyatt's bazzite install, I think he is going to move forward with
hyprland as his main.  Somehow after trying to dual boot hyprland and bazzite
he ended up with bazzite dumping him into recovery mode on every boot and
saying the root account is locked.

I did learn how to mount and chroot into a bazzite partition that is running
btrfs and rpm-ostree.  I'm still only partly sure what I'm doing so not really
worth a post about.
