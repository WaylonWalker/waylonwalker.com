[kedro-static-viz](https://github.com/WaylonWalker/kedro-static-viz) is out with support for the newly released hooks feature.  This means that you can have `kedro-static-viz` automatically deploy a full gatsby site `before_pipeline_run` keeping your visualization always up to date.

Even though it is a static site there is no functionality lost.  The only thing that's missing is the flask server.  With [kedro-static-viz](https://github.com/WaylonWalker/kedro-static-viz) you can deploy your visualization to a number of static hosting providers such as GitHub pages free of charge with wicked fast performance

## ‚ö° It's Fast

Even though it's built on gatsbyjs the full site builds in under 2s even on slower hardware.  This is because the site is already pre-rendered and stripped of any excess.  It's zipped up right into the python package and is typically used with the cli, but now can be used with python, or as a hook as well.

> ### What is [kedro-viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) ü§î

Kedro viz is a fantastic kedro plugin that allows you to visualize your data pipeline.  Kedro allows you to quickly build production-ready pipelines where you just configure a catalog, then toss python functions into a big pile.  Kedro figures out the order everything needs ran in for you, allows you to run a datasets dependencies or dependents only.  [kedro-viz](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz) gives you a great way to see this ordering visually.

## Check out a live running example

Using the power of GitHub actions the I have built a kedro iris pipeline visualization that can be found on [https://static-viz.kedro.dev/](https://static-viz.kedro.dev/)

## Itching to get started with kedro

You can be up and running in a matter of minutes if you already have python running on your machine.

Make a virtual environment with your environment manager of choice.

``` python
conda create -n kedro-practice python=3.8 -y
conda activate kedro-practice
```

Install kedro. Then create a new project with their awesome cli template built on cookiecutter. Make sure to answer `y` to get a prebuilt example pipeline with data.

    pip install kedro kedro-static-viz
    kedro new

## Vizualize your pipeline with the cli „ÄΩ

For local use when you already have the full project `kedro viz` is a great tool to use, but this is an article about kedro-static-viz.

``` python
kedro-static-viz static-viz
```

Since we used `kedro-static-viz` you will have a new directory called `public` that you can host on any static web hosting service, like GitHub pages or Netlify.

## Ready to try out the new hooks feature üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Open up your `<project>/src/run.py` and add the hook to your `ProjectContext` class.  Next time you run your pipeline you will have an updated pipeline.

``` python
from kedro_static_viz.hooks import StaticViz

class ProjectContext(KedroContext):
   project_name = "kedro0160"
   project_version = "0.16.1"
   package_name = "kedro0160"
   hooks = [ StaticViz() ]
```

## Now Run that pipeline üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Run your pipeline and enjoy that fresh kedro viz each and every time you run your pipeline.

``` bash
kedro run
```
