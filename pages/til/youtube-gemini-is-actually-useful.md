I've found Gemini to be very useful lately, especially for finding information
within long form content.

When writing [thought-896](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/896), I
wanted to use a direct quote from Jeff Dickey, Gemini popped it out very
quickly.

``` md
give me a quote from jeff just before the timestamp I'm at the interviewer
asked what makes a good cli and he started talking about stdout/stderr
```

In another case, my wife and I are huge Good Eats fans.  Alton Brown taught us
how to cook during college and on.  We watched every single good eats episode
nearly 10 years after they aired.  He is back with some updates to those those
shows on his Youtube.  Gemini gives very good detailed responses with
timestamps.

``` md
Alton Brown had a recent YouTube video for cooking turkey. Can you get the
instructions from the video?
```
