Inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/)  I'm
starting a weeknotes retrospective post to recap the week.  The theme this week
has been learning and setting up obsidian to work within my workflow.  I have
setup an image workflow, and edited a whole bunch of metadata for old posts.
