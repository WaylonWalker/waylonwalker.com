Great Saturday, two big walks with the family and dogs. We are dogsitting the
neighbors dog and are getting both out and walking.  It was a beautiful day, a
bit hot, but great.  Wyatt and I walked all the way out to stonewater park, it
was a great walk but took us nearly an hour and it got a bit hot we were tired
when we got home.  Off to watch Millville National.
