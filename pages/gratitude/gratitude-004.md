#### Sleep

It does not get enough recognition, some good quality rest is very benefitial
to start off a good day. Yesterday I was dragging.. hard. Wyatt was up at 2
A.M. and I was the one to be up with him... for awhile. Today, he was up early
again, but let me sleep, then proceeded to take a morning nap. This combined
with an early rest time started my day off on a good note. I was able to wake
up when ready, and start my day at my own pace. I was able to get coffee and
breakfast before being asked to do much.

#### coffee

I enjoy starting my day off with a nice cup of coffee. Today, I had a nice
fresh thirty-thirty guatememala. I am very grateful that we are able to afford
nice coffee, it really energizes me compared to the really dark mass produced
coffee that is typically found everywhere.
