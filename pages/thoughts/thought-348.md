This keyboard layout looks weird af the mix of column staggar and row stagger is wild.  Not sure if its genius or an abomination.

That solenoid though is absolutely wild though,  I kinda want one TBH.

and the clear plate with the diodes laid out on it in a herringbone pattern is a very nice touch.
