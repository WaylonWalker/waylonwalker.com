ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Waylon Walker.  Husband, Father of two, and creator things on the
web, learning, and teaching others.  I created my blogging platform from
scratch to learn about building tools with pluggy and diskcache.  I was
frustrated with long build times, black holes of node modules, bloated pages,
and a lack of built in SEO tools.

I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in building data pipelines and web
platforms with python.
