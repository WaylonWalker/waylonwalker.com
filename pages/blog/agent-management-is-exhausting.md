title: Agent Management Is Exhausting

The state of development in early 2026 is all wrapped around learning how to manage many agents, keep them all up and running in parallel.

The secret I've discovered works well for me right now is a good well defined plan.  This could be a markdown file or an issue.  Agents do really good at writing these for you, including reproduced steps for issues, spelling out the changes that need made.

**This** is your opportunity to read the issue, the plan, step in, look for halucinations, where its going off track and what its doing right.  Get in there and edit the plan.  I had one today where it laid out the steps to reproduce really well, but I was able to add network requests for more context to the issue.  This is the missing phase really tripping a lot of people up right now and it has agents doing things you didn't ask for or solving the wrong problem.

Now with all of this said, managing these things is exhausting.  Depending on the day they can move so damn fast compared to the time it takes you to do things.  Sometimes I can barely research, find, and raise issues as fast is it can implement features and fixes.

This is a completely different way of working that I have experienced before. It stretches a different part of the brain than I'm used to.  It requires learning new skills around issue tracking and management.  Knowing what models are good at what task.  Knowing when your session is going to go to shit from too much context, wrong context, a compaction.  Its all new skills with a very different workflow.

There is something different about them this year, I'm not going to be a hype bro and tell you your wrong, you probably want to give them a chance if you have the opportunity and actually learn good techniques, its not easy it requires managing and learning.
