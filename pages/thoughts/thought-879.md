> I did not realize that David's site was built on a homegrown Static Site Generator.  As someone who also does this myself I appreciate the effort.  I build my site on [[ markata ]].  It started as a project to learn a set of tools and has become a project that I depend on everywhere and cant put down.  It's a great tool, but you probably shouldn't use it.  Anyways, I feel this **really** shows on David's site. His site is filled with custom features that make it very unique, one off, and always a pleasure to read.
