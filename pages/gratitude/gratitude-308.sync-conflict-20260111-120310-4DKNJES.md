Long day of work, and I think I'm going backwards.  This was the first day off of Prednisone and its feeling like sick symptoms are getting worse.  There will be progress, I know there will be, but right now its not progress in the right direction.  This Christmas flu hit a lot of people hard this year, somehow our family got hit extra hard.  Glad that kids are feeling better and back in school.  I'm grateful that I can work from home and keep up with some light duty things, Less talking things from home.
