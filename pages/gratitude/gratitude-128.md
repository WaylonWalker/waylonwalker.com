We got a house, for real this time.  I am actually 99% sure, maybe 90%,
anyways it's solid.  We put in an offer and it was accepted this time.
It's very close to here, so Ayla will be going to the same school
district, different school.  Her 3rd year in school will also be her 3rd
school in the same district, all within a 5 minute drive of each other,
its wild.  It has an appropriate amount of space for all of us, and a
very big back yard that we plan to fence in and let the kids roam to
their hearts content as soon as we can.  It looks like a very nice house
we are excited to get started with our new journey in it.
