Bike rides have been the theme lately.  I am really excited that Wyatt has been
coming along to many of them lately, and Ayla for a few, but Wyatt usually
holds out a bit more and really gives dobby a good run.  It's quite fun, but we
go so fast that I have to hold Dobby back a bit, I just don't want him to make
the wrong move and get hit by the bike.  When we leave the house we have a
gentle downhill and he is fully pulling me on the bike all the way down.
