19 years, can you believe its been an entire 19 years.   We've been together
longer than our entire childhoods.  In a way it kinda feels weird how it
doesn't always work out for everyone, but for some reason, we both always knew
that it was going to work out for us.  Maybe its just that we knew that we
would be willing to put in the work to make it happen.  The next 19 will take
us all the way to 54!  That is wild, that puts us so close to halfway between
being kids and retired and able to do what we want.  Maybe by then we will had
grandkids idk, it sounds so far away right now, but so did 2024 when we first
were together.  Here's to the next 19.  Forever, ...
