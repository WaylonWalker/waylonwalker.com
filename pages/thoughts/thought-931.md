This is an abolute banger of a game on itch.  It nails the nes aesthetic while keeping true to the modern silksong movements.  You can play through the first boss Moss Mother, and where you start the first ascend into Bone Bottom.  I was in shock when I discovered the little climb effect hornet does when you just cant quite make a jump, the hold jump for height is on point.  Her downstrike with the hunters crest is perfect.
