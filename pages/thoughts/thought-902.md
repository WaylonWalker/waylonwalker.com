While the non deterministic nature of llms scare the heck out of me in the sense of just cutting it loose on my writing.  letting it go through all of my files and just edit them.  I do like the idea of mundane tools like "desaturate", "Gaussian blur", evolving out of it for text.  I don't yet see this with the tools we have now, but it will be interesting to see them evolve.
