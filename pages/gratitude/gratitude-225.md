Last night was the last night of Annie Jr, we did strike (set tear down) and
transported everything to the storage unit 20 minutes away, it was a long
night.  I am so happy for Ayla and how well she did in this show, she left it
all out on stage the last night.  She focused on staying in character and doing
her role.  We are so proud of her and excited for the next one... after a break.
