Great conversation with Billy Basso the creator of Animal Well on the code architecture of Animal well.  It's all hand crafted C++. He talks about early games he tried to build being heavy in oop, and really got lost in oop.  Animal well is very flat, there is no inheritance, just lists of entities that all implement similar methods in their own way.  Layering and order of entities becomes very important.  Its crazy how much he had to think about hardware and MS build being very helpful with this, but needing to know all of the console apis.
