> Hurl was mentioned by [@gerhard](https://gerhard.io/) on the latest [changelog and Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvC7497CJJs&t=3001s).  Looks  like a feature rich easy to use testing tool that is tested via what looks like a config file.

> Hurl is a command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format.
> It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very versatile: it can be used for both fetching data and testing HTTP sessions.
> Hurl makes it easy to work with HTML content, REST / SOAP / GraphQL APIs, or any other XML / JSON based APIs.
