It's interesting how many people in tech maintain a blog.  I think part of this brings us back to web 1.0 days when so many individual websites owned the web it was a free for all unindexed land and you got to own a small piece of it.

I agree with most of Brittany's points here I write a lot to keep my skills sharp, and to refer back to.  Brittany mentions keeping all her old posts, even the cringy ones.  I'm all with you here, I'm just wodering how you look back at anything you wrote in the past and not get a bit of that feel, maybe its just me, but I see cringe and mistakes gallore, but it all makes me better moving forward.
