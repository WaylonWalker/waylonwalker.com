Great Saturday winding down from the end of vacation, helping Ayla heal up from
her procedure and just chillin.  Nothing but just low key chill day before we
get back to the work week.  Made tacos with Wyatt, I always love when the kids
come in to help and take over making one of the dishes on their own.  It gives
them something to do, takes something off of my plate, and gives them a skill
they will have for life.  Wyatt made guac for the tacos, and he does a damn
good job of it.  It warms my heart to see them do something autonomously like
this and enjoy eating it together.

> Wyatt thought this was the **perfect** avocado cut.
