> Ben is always good for a banger of a video, this images app is something that i really want in my homelab, he did some great polish here!  The idea of building vibe coded applications for your own personal use with all of your own personal opinions and workflows is something that has been an appealing part of ai,  I've definitely tossed a few apps in my homelab that I use occasionally and they do what I ask of them pretty accurately.

This feels great to use, but also seems to kill any startup idea I have, as most of them feel like they could be vibe coded out by someone with a bit of skill and they just host their own.  Maybe this is a good thing, maybe we are moving into an era of more people owning their own app they use for themself, maybe i need a security related startup?
