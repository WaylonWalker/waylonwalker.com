I try to use conventional commits on all of my commits, but I often end up only using feat/fix.  I need to keep this page handy and get new verbiage worked into my language 

* fix:
* feat:
* build:
* chore:
* ci:
* docs:
* style:
* refactor:
* perf:
* test:

Optionally include a scope `fix(parser):`

A bang indicates a breaking change note. For example ...

``` bash
chore!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.
```

!!! note

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
    about someone else's content online #thoughts
