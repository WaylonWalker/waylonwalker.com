> It really feels like M$ is coming down hard on GH lately to make some unfavorable decisions for users.  Maybe there is good reason for all of these changes from a business perspective, I can't judge that.  But right now there are some really great alternatives out there.  I'm so grateful for what forgejo and gittea offer, and at the same time seeing the community get split up from GH is sad.
