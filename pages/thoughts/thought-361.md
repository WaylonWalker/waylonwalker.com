Niklas Luhmann created the Zettelkasten method of notetaking, He was the Da Vinci of writing, holding a high standard that we can take inspiration from even today in this digital era.

As many times as I have seem the Zettelkasten covered, I never knew that it roughly translated to little cards in a box.


## Four Principles

Mischa lays out four principles of Zettelkasten.

* Atomic - _each card conains one idea_
* Link - _cards are linked together_
* Structure - _comes from the links_
* Own Words - _You write the note in your own words_

My blog, tils, and thoughts make up my own zettelkasten.  I am not going to say that mine is a perfect representation of his method, but the components are here.  rather than building books, my thoughts and tils build up to blog posts.   The rate of blog posts I write definitely changes with the seasons of life, as seasons change it becomes a bigger or smaller part of the season.

I really like Mischa's most important note to Write in your own words, this is what really promotes learning, and proves to yourself that you can form a thought around the topic.  Up until recently I've wrote everything, but lately I've taken to copy pasting some quotes into my thoughts posts, but I think this is fine, because generally its used to build on the narrative and give me a place to talk about the linked post.
