This is a wild concept for a slicer, essentially he didn't even make a slicer just a crazy  pre-process and post prossess to cura slicer,  deforming the part until it doesn't have any overhangs, creating a normal planar slice, then undeforming the output from cura.  He also mentions that the rapid moved needed modified as well. I'm assuming this is because they are generally long distances and not short, without breaking these long lines up we would still end up wtih a straight line after deform.
