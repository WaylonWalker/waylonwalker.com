We got a passing home inspection today.  There were comments on it of course, a
few things we need to fix up, and a few things that we requested to be cleared
up before finalizing the deal.  But nothing seemed like a deal stopper at all.
Rhiannon keeps superstaring all the documents within the hour they hit our
inbox she has them turned around and back on the different places involved.
Again this feels like such a huge process, I am so grateful that we found such
a great team to help us through it successfully.
