> I've long avoided running ads on my blog for the same reason.  For a few months I ran an ad above the fold.  It was a "Your Ad Here" kind of thing, and in the messaging I was looking for content relevant to my content, not google driven ads. This resulted in nothing, no hits, not a one.  I'm kinda with Will on this one beer money is not worth degrading the project for.  I seriously thought some of the big projects with a moderate level of success got a good cut for these sponsorships.  Some of the companies are big companies, like how do they even go through meetings and decide who gets beer money without spending more than that in decision making resources.  Maybe they have a guy with more autonomy than I would expect.
