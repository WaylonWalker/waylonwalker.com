2025 is not the year to get put on the market, its rough out there.  Junior's have little chance, senior+ are even struggling.  We had it easy from 2020-2023, now its over saturated and you have to want to be in this industry to be here and stay here.  It used to be a fine place to get a good job to pay the bills, the bar has been raised and if you don't want to be here you are going to struggle.  Theo covers this in this linked video deeply [[ thoughts-472 ]].
