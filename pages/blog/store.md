I've been 3d printing for years, and create a lot of my own designs.  Many of
them are hyper specific to me, but for the ones that I think others might find
useful I will be putting up here for sale, you can buy prints that will show up
to your door in a few days.  I'm leaning on the slant3d print farm so this
depends on your proximity to them.  The prints are typically black petg, if you
would like a different color reach out to me and I will see what other options
we have, or for an additional fee I can print it myself and ship out
special colors.

These are all designs that I made and actually use myself, they bring me joy
knowing that I made just the thing that I wanted to exist and if you buy
something I hope that it brings you this joy as well.

## Skateboard Wall Mount

I've used these skateboard wall mounts for years, I have 5 in my office
featuring new decks in the queue, and probably 10 in the garage to display used
decks, and fully assembled boards for me and my kids.  I use these for both
regular popscicle boards and longboards, but if you are putting up a thicker
longboard go with the thicker size.

## Mic stand Clips

These clips will hold your cables on your mic stand nicely and look nice while
doing it.  I've got them on both of my mic stands, there are two versions, one
for a smaller stand with usb cable, and one for a larger stand with an xlr
  cable make sure you measure your mic stand before buying.

## Cat Door

In our house we have a cat liter box in the basement, so we need to leave the
door open for our cat.  But if our dog goes down there he seems to only cause
trouble.  So I modeled this door prop to leave the door just enough open for
the cat, but keep the dog out.
