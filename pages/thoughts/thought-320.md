> Interesting, linux supports 32 programmable buttons, special buttons that do nothing that hotkey programs like xbindkeys can pick up and run things, seems like it would be very intersting to use on a macro pad.  You could easily do dynamic and complex tasks without clashing that keybinding with something else.

I'm going to look into this for my next obs setup.  No matter what I try to do with the hyper key it always tends to do odd things depending on the application I am in.  typically its tmux, and it starts trying to do something I don't want it to.
