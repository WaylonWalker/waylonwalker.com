I am grateful for our pets and their health, they can be quite the pains in the
arses.  Ginger cant stay out of food and wakes everyone up if she senses she
can get food, and Dobby is in a barking phase.  But they bring so much love and
joy to the house.  Wyatt loves his cat so much they have quite the special
relationship that is irreplaceable.  She puts up with so much from him and
gives him all the love when he is anxious.  Both animals know when Rhiannon is
down and having a hard day and cuddle up with her.  Ginger is our guard cat,
she guards the door anytime we are gone.  Today Mom lost her dog Cali, it's sad
to hear that she is gone and really makes me appreciate our animals.
