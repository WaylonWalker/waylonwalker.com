Thinking about kedro pipelines from my phone in a parking lot here. I'm thinking about big picture what's next for my pipelines.  I want an effective Dr plan. I want to create telemetry endpoints for catalog.  This will enable the Dr plan to identify  critical data that is not created by a pipeline and communication points to other teams.
