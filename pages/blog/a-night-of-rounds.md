Tonight my son and I played rounds, I pulled clips of all the final rounds of
each set of rounds.  We play hardly any games with guns in them, this is one of
the few exceptions, it feels quite whimsical, fun, and strategic, and not at
all realistic or first person.  The strategy part really brings me back to the
fps games I would play with friends in my teens.

## Round 1 - Orange

I thought I had him on this one.  I had this rare power up that allows me to
shot through walls.  It came down to the very last round and he had too much
firepowerfor me.

## Round 2 - Blue

The final round of round 2 was Super fast.  I felt like I nerfed my homing
power up by adding fastball to it and it didn't really home in anymore.  What
made it so quick, I think he had glass cannon and I laid down two well placed
shots.

## Round 3 - Orange

Round three he got some really good cards, but too much firepower and stacking
bouncy and ricochet made it too much to control and he friendly fired both
rounds.

## Round 4 - Blue

Round 4 I stacked up radiance and saw and just went for it.  Radiance emits the
power of the sun while reloading, so I went in guns blazin, pulled the shield
for saw and ran at him.

## Round 5

Round 5 I stacked up a multi shot, Big bullet, and timed explosion.  I didn't
let off the firepower and there was no chance.
