"[[ Clippy ]] no Simpy" is a term coined by Louis Rossmann, when people try to
stand up for companies doing scummy things like charging your for features that
you already own, taking the companies best interest ahead of the consumers.
This is often used when companies change the terms and conditions after you
make your purchase requiring something like a subscription to use the product
you already own.
