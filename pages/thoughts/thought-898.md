I actually like linus's take here.  My parents dropped $4k (~$8k in todays money) on a computer when I was a kid, (which turned into something too $$ to let me touch at that point).  I played some educational games that no one else has heard of and I've long forgotten along with an early ciivilization game.  It was e-waste in 2 years we maybe kept it 5, and it was barely working.  Contrast this to my PC now I spent $2k on 3 years ago refurb from 2017, and it has no signs of age from me, does everything I need it to.  Ram crisis sucks, the outright reason behind it sucks.  But on the bright side you can still get a baller build for less than you could late 90s without inflation.  The industry is not there for consumers right now, we had better times, but its still not bad times.  Keep the hope alive that good times will come.
