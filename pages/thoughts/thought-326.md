Damn, supply chain vector attacks are wild. Random guy in Primes stream was getting $40k offers to buy their open source project while in university and they have never made anything from it.  What a social engineering attack this is.  It would be so easy to make it look like a good deal and that the package was going to a good new owner who has real resources to maintain it.
