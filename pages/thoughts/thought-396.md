MX keycap stem dimensions.  I used these to create my new caps and all these dimensions worked great.  The one dimension I had issues with was the outer diameter off the cap stem, not shown here.  5.3mm ended up being a good outer diameter for me.  I print them at an angle and the bottom of the stem can get a bit of sag, pressing out on the outer wall of the switch and can actually stick the key.
