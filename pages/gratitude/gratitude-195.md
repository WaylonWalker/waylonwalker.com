Today we opened up the game Skip-Bo for the first time in quite awhile, Ayla is
pretty darn good at the game.  She really loves playing physical card and board
games like this.  Skip-Bo and Uno are great ones that are simple enough for
her, yes does not get too boring for the adults.  We played two games, I took
the first round and she took the second.
