Jake Bolam principal engineer at Meta, has some of the best career advice for
those looking to become principal or just be better at their craft.  This
[video](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxFp3xC-SrxNtLw3FW24b26DRhNrMra3m8) was
such a banger I had to bring it in as a full post, and not just a thought. It
was a random YouTube auto play, something that I probably wouldn't have clicked
on given title an thumbnail, but turned out to be very impactful.  Jake is such
a smart guy with a lot of great insights, and I can tell he thinks really quick
on his feet, he just pulled all of these things out of his head on the fly.

!!! Note "WIP"
    I'm still working on this post, have a scheduled publish date, but hope to
    finish before then.

## Long onboarding

Jake had a super long period of onboarding at meta, he came in as a seasoned
leader yet took many months to get going.  This was a phase during or near the
end of the covid-19 pandemic and his team was so swamped they were unable to
give him time to help him.  He felt his on boarding was taking longer than he
wanted, and found backend work at Instagram.  Moving to Instagram he jumped in
and starting making impact quick and found his way moving up the ladder serving
as tech lead for several teams.

> I grabbed a ton of clips from this video, but did not for this section as it was kinda long.

## Always open for a Chat

As busy as Jake is, he leaves "Always open for a chat" on his internal profile.
He does not care about rank into account, the intern can ask for a coffee chat.
His key metric is how well is this person receiving information.  If they are
coming back with the same questions every 3 months he is going to start telling
them he does not have the time.

I've had a fair amount of personal experience with this.  Early in my career I
experience quite a bit of higher ranks feeling untouchable, they were
impossible to get a hold of, blew you off, and had more meetings than anyone
could bear.  It made me really look outside the company for inspiration and
mentorship most of the time.

## There's always time for coffee

While I don't have "Always open for a chat" on my
profile,  I've had many of these types of conversations with my peers.  It
might be about something career related or more often how to implement
containers, cloud, and good practices into small teams.

I remember a course in college shared the famous quote "There's always time for
coffee" and it stuck with me.  The demonstration goes that no matter how much
you fill your day with big rocks and tiny sand particles, theres always a
little more room for coffee, and he dumps coffee into a jar that he has already
filled up.

These conversations often become very impactful.  They can lead to having good
relationships or job opportunities.

## If we are not getting enough feedback, move faster
