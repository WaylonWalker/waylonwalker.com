> Sometimes, all you need is a mindset shift, a blocker in your mind that holds you back from doing certain things. And for me, I have consumed enough tutorials and posts about Kubernetes, that I need to put to use and create. I have been stuck in the learning cycle, lets push to prod with kubernetes.

This hurts.  I know others with this learning style that need to see the full picture before actually doing something with new tech.  The way I first got into kubernetes I was looking for the easy route and somehow k8s came up several times as a suggested route [[ looking-for-a-heroku-replacement ]], So I dove in head first with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) and [kompose](https://kompose.io/).  What I found was that it was not all that hard once you start to see how the pieces fit together, no amount of reading tutorials would have gotten me there.

Let's Gooo.  Use what is right for you and stop parroting kubernets is hard, heavy, for big companies, maybe actually try it first.
