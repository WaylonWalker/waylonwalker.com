> The hype bro influencer culture is over, we are fucking burnt the fuck out.  I'm done scrolling through ai slop on social media, I like in a few times a week with hopes to see some friends at the top of my feed and jump out.  The Doom and Gloom of politics, everyone has a side that will bring glory and the other side will start an apocalypse did me in, ai generated bs is just driving those platforms further into the ground, I'm tired and done.

I'm starting to lean into RSS, I hope for projects like [Sam](https://simplecto.com/author/sam/) mentions here make this more possible for the average person.  I hope that real people make awesomelists like he mentions.  I hope that the internet becomes more human again.
