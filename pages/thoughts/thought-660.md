> > The object storage (S3-compatible) platform MinIO created a bit of a stir this week 

I had not heard about this before it came in through selfh.st.  I use minio a lot, and did not know there are so many great alternatives out there for it.  I might be looking into some of these options such as [garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/?ref=selfh.st).  

Its hard to tell from this article what mino dropped, but luckily for me it seems to be all ui related.    I use the UI for debugging/feedback/sometimes learning, but at this point I've got good flows for setting up new access keys, buckets, and everything with the cli.
