Rhiannon is kicking butt today 🦵!  She finished setting up our movers,
started looking into full house cleaning services.  And the greatest
jeans ever came in the mail... for me!  I've wore holes right through my
favorite jeans that I wear every single day, and have been needing to
replace them.  She went the extra mile and researched the most
comfortable dad jeans ever.  Mom jeans are a pretty popular thing, and
keep your crack in, Dad jeans though, I was completely convinced these
did not exist.  She found some.  They fit and move so much better than
my old ones.
