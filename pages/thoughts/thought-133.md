ollama is the easiest to get going local llm tool that I have tried, and seems to be crazy fast.  It feels faster than chat gpt, which has not been the experience I have had previously with running llm's on my hardware.


``` bash
curl https://i.jpillora.com/jmorganca/ollama | bash
ollama serve
ollama run mistral
ollama run codellama:7b-code
ollama list
```
