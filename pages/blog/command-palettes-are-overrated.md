Command palettes are slow, and overrated, you should treat yourself better.
You probably installed VSC*** out of the box and your co-workers see you using
the mouse and repremanded you as they should.  Mouse usage is not ok if you are
a software dev, you should have the cheap ass free mouse that came with your
cousins dell machine five years ago and only use if for emergencies.  If you
want to be fast you cannot do that by moving cursors to imprecice locations and
clicking with your hand.  You are not a caveman, put down the stones and get
with the damn times.  You need to be moving with precision.

## Stage One, the command palette

So you are taking your first few baby steps away from that logitech Mx Master
and you need to get shit done, during these infant months the command palette
is your friend.  Use it you will be 10x faster than Razer Naga Ron from
accounting.  If you are in an ide like VSC***or a JEttedBrains editor they
come with a command palette for running commands and fuzy finding files, use
it.  If you are in nvim, move on you probably don't need this, unless you are
still teething on VSC***, during that tim use `:Telescope commands`.

## Close the fn Tree

You don't need a goddamn file tree open all the goddamn time, its taking up
screen space and filling your brain with useless shit.  They can be a helpful
tool to move, rename, refactor files, or familiarize yourself with a codebase,
but you don't use one if you want to walk someday, so just like the command
palette we are going to give it up for fuzzy find.  If you are in nvim you are
going to want to use `:Telescope find_files`  those other big brained ides have
things, look up the keybinding.

## Now that we are crawling

As you start to get your legs under you and you can crawl away from mamas teet
note down the commands that you use all the time, we want to get command
palette usage way down.  Not to zero, without some sort of fuzzy command picker
(even `:<tab>`) you are probably trying to remember too much and allocating too
many brain cells to editing text, don't do that.
