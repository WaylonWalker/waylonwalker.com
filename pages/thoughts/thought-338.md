> miniserve is a sweet http server, replacement for `python -m http.server`.  It's fast, runs off a small binary, but why would I want to use it over something that already exists on most machines, because it includes a bunch of features like qr codes, pretty themes, and uploads.  I've used `python -m http.server` many times to transfer files from one machine to another in a pinch, like at a family members house.  But what if they have an android, windows, or something not easy to get a python repl running on, you can run miniserve and upload from their device rather than hosting from their device.
