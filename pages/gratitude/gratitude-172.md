title: Gratitude 172

---

Hooof, what a day... I am so grateful that I am able to have the flexibility I
have with work.  The kids were just tearing each other apart if left alone at
all today.  It was just insane how quickly I would leave them to utter
destruction.  It's all ok though.  I got a few things done at least, and
everyone survived.
