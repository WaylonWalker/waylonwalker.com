It's been quite a busy Month and a half since my last official newsletter With about 14 individual posts going live since then. I pushed hard over the past two weeks and just made a lot of content about things that I actually do. Many of these were things that I know quite well and were quite quick to write. I really enjoyed putting them out there and seeing all of the comments and feedback roll in.

## Highlights

### [Integration testing with Python, TestProject.io, and GitHub Actions](https://waylonwalker.com/testproject-io-py-actions/)

I learned the most from this post. It's been awhile since I had done any testing with selenium and I wanted to brush up on those skills for some upcoming work. I chose to test my own website, run it on github actions and use TestProject for reporting.

### [Creating Reusable Bash Scripts](https://waylonwalker.com/reusable-bash/)

### [ü§ì What's on your GitHub Profile](https://dev.to/waylonwalker/what-s-on-your-github-profile-40p3)

GitHub profiles were released recently and I asked on DEV.to "Whats on your GitHub Profile". This was a discussion that turned out some incredible response. There are so many great profiles posted in the discussion section. Check them out for inspiration on yours.

### [üî• How to crush amazing posts on DEV](https://dev.to/waylonwalker/how-to-crush-amazing-posts-on-dev-4cgh)

This post was super fun to write. It's specifically for writing DEV.to posts, but is generally useful to any medium length content that sits between a tweet and a book. I definitly learned a few things during research and in the discussion. I have picked up a few tricks that make my posts a bit easier to scan and get a bit better engagement than having a wall of text.

Pariss is quite an inspiration. She has done so much work to create a better place for POC in tech. I like that not only is she helping them get jobs but acting as a mentor for their first few months on the job to make sure that they are able to find their place and fit in.
