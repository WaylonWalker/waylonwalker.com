This really makes me want to try Dolphin Mixtral with ollama now.  It looks very impressive from this video.  The ability to keep adding features before becoming confused is though with a lot of these llms.

Being chat based, this is not a co pilot replacement.  I was really hoping for an in line co pilot like tool that I can run locally.  I have not used co pilot yet, but I have had great luck with codeium.
