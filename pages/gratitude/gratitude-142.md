Today I got some good Dobby training time in.  He and I took a long walk
around the park. He did really good, even in the deep snow that we have
going on.  Later on tonight we did a bit of training.  This was my first
chance at training with treats, and its amazing how fast just a young
pup is picking up commands.  He seems REALLY smart compared to most
other animals that I have had close contact with.  It could also be that
with Rhiannons great research we are starting him off on the right foot.
