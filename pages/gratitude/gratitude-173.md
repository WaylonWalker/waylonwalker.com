So we started the podcast back up, and it was super fun.  Rhiannon and I
just recorded a podcast super tired and exhausted, but no excuses we did
it, we recorded a damn podcast.  It actually didn't turn out that great
because my stupid interface went low on me, but whatever we did it.  I'm
actually excited to get back into it and make some time each week to
just chat to her about whatever.
