Back to work tomorrow, cannot believe how quick the break went!!!  This year was twofold, we went on a real vacation this year and used a lot of vacation days, also we were all sick for the entire break.  I pushed through the last day of work as the illness was kicking in, now just getting to the other side of it and its already time to go back.  I did finally take time for a new keyboard build.  Its working really well so far.  I am missing quite a few keys, but have enough to make this post pretty effectively.  New switches arrive on Saturday and Ill fully finish it.  So far the build feels really good, everything went together solid and feels good so far.  Battery percentage feels like its reporting right on my phone and  its working 100% wirelessly.  The worst part is that I turned on ironing on the print and this filliment did not agree with it that well.
