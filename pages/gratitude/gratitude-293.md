Thanksgiving day, the van is packed and warm.  The house filled with anxious energy as we prepare to leave for the long trek to spend the day with family.  We will get to spend some needed time with those we love, those we've grown apart from , but keep in touch for these few times per year.  I'm grateful that we are able to join.  We have a nice warm, reliable ride there.  Kids have plenty of activities and generally Rhiannon and I engage in deeper discussions and dive into longer form podcasts that. We usually do together.  Ready and off for the long drive.
