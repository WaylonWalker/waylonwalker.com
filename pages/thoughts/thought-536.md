> For my next drive upgrade in my homelab I am gong to be using one of these factory recertified drives from serverpartdeals.com.  Found them on an LTT video awhile back.  They are some lightly used and recertified, fully burnt in drives.

> Shop for drives that are certified once again by the manufacturer to work like new. Factory ReCertified drives are cost-effective alternatives compared to factory-sealed new counter parts. Additionally, unlike in mass production, the re-certification process involves closer attention to the overall operation of the hardware so that the re-certification will not have to happen a 2nd time
