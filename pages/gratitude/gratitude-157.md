Another busy one today!  Lot's of people in and out of the house to get
all of our services up and running.  I think we are gettting settled in
pretty well.  Tomorrow we will be able to access our basement, and have
nothing scheduled, so we will be able to just do the things that we
need/want to do without needing to be somewhere else.
