The most under hyped, under engineered text editor overtype.  Going to be popping this into some places like [[ thoughts ]], and maybe more, looks small and easy to use.  Gives just a bit of nice features over a text editor.

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
    about someone else's content online #thoughts
