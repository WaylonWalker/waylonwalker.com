> Everything is becoming political these days!  I hate it.  I regularly hear a friend say these podcasts need to set the politics to the side, but you know what its fukin hard when the gov is upending every corner  of life and rebranding it with their own new twist.  The billionaire class is winning and it looks like there ain't a thing we can do about it.  Here's another example of someone taking head of an office they have no business being in.  An entire set of working class folks let go for this guy to take over.  And what does he want to do, make govt services as satisfying as apple.  Apple is cutting edge, it is not something that is one bit sustainable.  Their launch sites are generally super heavy, hard to scroll, slow, over animated, but damn they are satisfying the first time you scroll through them, after that just let me through.
