Distrobox is so interesting and cool, I've only recently started realizing how much it can do especially related to hardware and graphics, this is quite an example that runs obs in a distrobox.  I had no idea distrobox would let you connect to cameras and gpus so seemlessly, and give you a gui to work from. And with distrobox you can export so that it just looks like an app on your system.
