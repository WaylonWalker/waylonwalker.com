Ayla finished out her fourth show tonight and did so great.  Opening night she
really struggled with energy at the end, and tonight she came out on stage and
knocked it out so well no matter how tired she felt.  After the show everyone
is congratulating each other, she does such a good job at making sure to to
congratulate everyone and make sure they know they did a good job.  I am so
grateful for how well the show is ran and how great this community is.
