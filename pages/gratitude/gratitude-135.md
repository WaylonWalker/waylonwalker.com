Today felt busy AF.  It was just a solid day of activity.  Tyring to get Ayla
through her homework, through school, Deployed 2 projects at work, and.... and
.... we are getting ready for Dobby to come home tomorrow.  I am so excited for
him to be home with us.  Everyone is.  Its just so joyful to see the excitement
that everyone has for him.  Rhiannon has done some fantastic research to
understan what we need to do to trai him properly.  We have never gotten a pet
that was not a rescue.  This was in part to knowing the family he is coming
from, and the fact that he is going to be Rhiannons medical alert animal.  We
wanted him to be trained from t start for what she needs him to do.  So excited
for the big day.
