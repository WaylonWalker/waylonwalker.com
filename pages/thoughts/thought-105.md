The `htmx-request` class is added to `htmx-target` elements.  You can target this css selector to create  loading state throbbers.

By default the target element will the `self`, but you can use the typical htmx css selector to select which element will recieve the `htmx-request` class while the request is running.

The only way to override the name of the class is through config.
