People who are quick to toss team members under a bus are not well trusted or
highly thought of and it will lead to some toxic team dynamics.

## Building Steam

While collaborating on any project there are going to be decisions made that
aren't necessarily your favorite, during a summer internship my mentor made
some decisions that I was not on board with, but I accepted his wisdom and
moved forward with little push back.

## Full Spead Ahead

During a review, leadership showed interest in the option that I wanted to go
towards.  I was quick to jump up and say I  told you so right then and there
and pitch reasons why my idea was so much better.

of being a good trustworthy team player.

## Speak your Mind, be heard, shut up

This day I learned that there is a time to speak your mind.  While that bus is
sitting idle it would have hurt no one.

There were times to hear out ideas, and there were times that we need to accept
the decisions the team made.  The team that you were a part of and had a chance
to steer.

There are times where it's appropriate to sit down and shut up.
