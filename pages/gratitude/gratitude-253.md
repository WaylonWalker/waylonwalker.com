Tough day today, not sure what happened, went to a doc appt and got nauseous on
the way and it never kicked throughout the day.  So happy to have my supportive
wife help get me to stop working, stop worrying about the kids and take a
break.  Also she is fucking crushing it right now so proud of her.  She is
hitting the gym early in the day, she is rocking getting all of the kids's
school stuff lined up, and working through their mountain of emotions on the
way back.  I appreciate everything she does so much.
