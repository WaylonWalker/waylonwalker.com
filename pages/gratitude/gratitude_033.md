#### Safety

Today started out like most days, morning routine, kids in the car and headed to preschool.  Since Rhiannon got the January mug at Starbucks we have been stopping there for the morning coffee on the way to preschool.  As we were leaving a police car came roaring from the parking lot lights on right behind us.  There was an accident at the intersection right in front of Starbucks.  Passing by the accident it clearly looked like one car took more damage than the other, and that it was from being hit by another car and pushed into a pole at a high speed.  My heart goes out to them! It made me really grateful that we have not been in any accidents, especially because we typically drive down a very crazy road in the mornings.  It is not uncommon to come accross accidents along the way.
