awrit is a full graphical browser that runs inside of kitty.  I've moved on some of my machines away from kitty as the maintainer has seemed so hostile and there are other great therminals out there, but I'm going to give this a go.  I have kitty running on my hyprland setup as it is the default anyways.  It is actual chromium rendering to a kitty graphics protocol.
