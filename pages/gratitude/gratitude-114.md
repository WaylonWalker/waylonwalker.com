We made it through the first week back at it.  I am so grateful that We made it
through the important meetings with Ayla's school, and Rhiannon is still
testing negative for COVID.  It's heartbreaking to see that she is so sick, yet
everything reads as if she is just fine.  I wish there was something that we
could do for her, but the doctors just don't do much when all the labs come
back "fine".  Again I am grateful that is has not yet proved to be something
super dangerous.  Doing my best to keep it positive in this space, but the
unknown can be quite scary with this one.
