While updating my site to use Markata's new configurable head I ran into some
escaping issues.  Things like single quotes would cause jinja to fail as it was
closing quotes that it shouldnt have.

## Jinja Escaping Strings

Jinja comes with a handy utility for escaping strings.  I definitly tried to
over-complicate this before realizing.  You can just pipe your variables into
`e` to escape them.  This has worked pretty flawless at solving some jinja
issues for me.

``` html
<p>
{{ title|e }}
</p>
```

## Creating meta tags in Markata

The issue I ran into was when trying to setup meta tags with the new
configurable head, some of my titles have single quotes in them.  This is what
I put in my `markata.toml` to create some meta tags.

``` toml
[[markata.head.meta]]
name = "og:title"
content = "{{ title }}"
```

Using my article titles like this ended up causing this syntax error when not
escaped.

``` python
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
Exception ignored in: <function Forward.__del__ at 0x7fa9807192d0>
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
```

## jinja2 escape

After making a complicated system of using `html.escape` I realized that jinja
included escaping out of the box so I updated my `markata.toml` to include the
escaping, and it all just worked!.

``` toml
[[markata.head.meta]]
name = "og:title"
content = "{{ title|e }}"
```
