First day back to work for the new year I feel much more tired after a day of
work, never in my life did I think I would say that about office work, but hard
thinking all day takes more out of you than one realizes.  Being up multiple
times throughout the night also likely plays into it.

Anyways all went pretty well, It was good to see everyone (online).  There was a
moment where I was pretty heads down problem solving live in front of two
co-workers, Actually trying to get their project working for them so they could
continue on without me, and the kids just erupted.  I was so grateful that
Rhiannon had my back, she got the kids what they needed and I was able to finish
up that working session fairly quick, and get them going.
