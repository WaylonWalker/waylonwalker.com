This tip of using tinkercad to do boolean operations on an stl of a solid gridfinity bin and an outline is absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥.  This feels like a relatively simple operation, but to do it to a generated stl proves hard to do in most modeling software, at least harder than it needs to be.  Somehow tinkercad got it right and made it a very basic operation to do.

It took me a minute to find the Merge button that Uncle Jessy mentioned, they call it a group in TinkerCAD.
