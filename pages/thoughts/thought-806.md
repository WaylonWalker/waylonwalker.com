We need more mullets (as sam describes them).  Not so serious, but serious when it counts.  Ready to back you up, get some shit shipped, roll up their sleeves and do the work, stand up in front of people and pitch ideas.  We have too many hustle bros pitching shit they cant do, ai doomers who have been here 10 minutes think they can replace everything they don't understand with a word calculator, framework Andys afraid to ship till its [[ perfect ]].  Grow a Mullet.
