Getting back into our rythm.  It's starting to feel busy here again,
work is cranking along with quite a bit of pull.  I have have 1 of 3
major pieces of the next release of one of my big projects submitted for
PR!  Wyatt and I are fully in scratch and having a good 3 sessions per
day.  Rhiannon and I have a really big meeting with the school tomorrow,
so I am trying to read up a bit on that as I can.  Ayla and I had a full
silly swinging around session.  I am just so grateful to feel the love
from all angles of life.  It's chaotic sometimes, but in a very loving
manner.  I couldn't be any happier.
