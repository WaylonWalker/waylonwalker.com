This is madness that Wes Bos made this with manifold.js and no openscad!  Yes, I have these stupid brackets everywhere, yes, I hand model my own brackets.  No I don't do it enough.  I don't like that these model generators like openscad cannot make fillets and chamfers, but I appreciate the heck out of the speed and automation you can make iterations of things.
