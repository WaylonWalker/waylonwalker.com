Only 1 hour into the release of silksong, and it's taken down all of the eshops, and steamdb dows 100K concurrent players.  The Humble store ran out of steam keys for silksong already.

You guys better not break this thing before I get off work and My son gets home cause we are playing this tonight!!

I just Check [steamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/), and they have 441K concurrent players right now.  An Indie game!  This shows when you treat your fans right and make something incredible they stand behind you.
