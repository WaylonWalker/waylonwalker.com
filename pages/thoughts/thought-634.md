Just listened to this as I am really starting to get into grafana and feel like there isn't a mountain of setup this time around realizing how much of my stack is brand new.  Drill Down and Alloy are both new and key to my setup.  The Ai integrations at the end sound wicked good, I will be interested if you can do similar things with an MCP vs how much proprietary  stuff needs grafana cloud.
