css if() just landed, I'm struggling to understand what I an do with this that I can't do with something as old as classes.  I can get it if I don't have control over html creation or js to add classes.  The example that Una shows includes data that could directly be a classname with a set of styles in css rather than this crazy css variable unpacking out of a data attribute and an if statement.
