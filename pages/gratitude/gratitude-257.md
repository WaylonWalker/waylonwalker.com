On the eve of the final day of summer I'm thinking back to the summer that our
kids had, it was a fantastic summer filled with activity.  Boy did we have more
activities and camps and vacations than ever.  I'm so proud of Ayla for
discovering her love for theater and allowing Rhiannon and I to discover our
love of set building.  I'm proud for Wyatt sticking through his dnd camps and
getting out to socialize.  Our vacation to lake Michigan is one that we will
never forget and will likely go back for.  Wyatt is now running arch BTW and
Ayla is writing her own screenplay.  Goodbye summer you were good to us, hello
new school year.
