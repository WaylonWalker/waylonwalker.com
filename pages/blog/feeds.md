I have several feeds that you can consume my content with.  Many posts will
cross between them, so if you would like to follow a certain stream of content
in your rss reader thats what this is for. This one might feel like it has some
extra noise with multiple posts per day, including starts, and instagram style
posts, for a bit less look at the [[ main ]] feed.

!!! Note TLDR
    If you are looking for everything look here <https://waylonwalker.com/archive/rss.xml>

## All


This is a feed of everything that I have published on my site to date
including [[ blog ]], [[ til ]], [[ thoughts ]], [[ stars ]], [[ shots ]],
[[ ping ]].

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/published)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/published/rss.xml)

## Main

Like the All feed, but drops the shots (instagram style posts) and stars
(github stars).

## til - daily(ish)

_think gist with a tweet_

This is a feed of all of my TIL's (Today I Learned).  These are generally short
single topic posts that I write up quickly.  They are generally things that are
fairly new to me, often things that I struggled to find support for on the
internet, and felt that It needed yet one more article with my voice.

* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/til/rss.xml)

## shots - daily(ish)

_think Instagram_

This feed is a collection of images, sometimes I post a few a day, sometimes a
few weeks will go by, it really just depends on what I have going on.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/shots)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/shots/rss.xml)

## pings - daily(ish)

_think tweet_

These are ephemeral thoughts that pop in my head and I post as they occur.
Maybe inspired by something I see or hear, but typically no more context is
provided.  I hate how social media has become very much trigger engagement
bait... This is adjacent to that, but I try to be less hard on the bait.

## Thoughts - daily+

These are generally my thoughts on a web page or some sort of url, except a
rare few don't have a link.  These are dual published off of my
[thoughts.waylonwalker.com](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com) site.  It's a
fully dynamically rendered site 2000's style.  Posts are stored in a database
and instantly available.  Almost all of the posts were written in a small
`<textarea>` field within a chrome extension that I built for it.

These posts are intended to in two ways.  One, link building for the author.  I
hope that I give the people helping me out along the way just a little bit of a
boost.  Two, they serve as a permanant commented bookmark for me to search, and
come back to later when I have forgotten where I have seen something.

## stars

I pull in all of my github stars into one feed [[ pesos ]] style.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/stars)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/stars/rss.xml)

## Recent

This is a shorter version of **All**, as it is filtered down to only the posts
created within the last 30 days.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/recent)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/recent/rss.xml)

## Blog - weekly/monthly

These are my full big **B** **B**log posts.  They are what I started writing,
typically take a bit more time to put together.  I write fewer of them these
days than I used to.  I'd like to think that they are the more polished posts
of the bunch.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/blog)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/blog/rss.xml)

## Today

These are only the posts that went live the day that the site last built.  If
my scheduled builds keep working as intended they are today's posts.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/today)
* [rss](https://waylonwalker.com/today/rss.xml)

## Python

These are all the posts related to the python programming language.

* [web](https://waylonwalker.com/python)

## Linux

These are all the posts related to linux.
