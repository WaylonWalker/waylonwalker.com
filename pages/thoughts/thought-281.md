> distrobox gives you `distrobox-host-exec` to run commands on the host. This is handy to get access to host level clis that you probably wouldn't want to run from the container like `podman`, `docker`, `flatpak`.


> DESCRIPTION
> distrobox-host-exec lets one execute command on the host, while inside of a container.
> 
> Under the hood, distrobox-host-exec uses host-spawn a project that lets us execute commands back on the host. If the tool is not found the user will be prompted to install it.
