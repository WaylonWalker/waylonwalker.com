It's been a lot lately, just a lot of everything, but it feels like things are
ligthening up.  Mostly with Rhiannon's help.  I really appreciate all that she
helps me with.  Lately she has been working with me to set good boundaries with
the kids.  Which is well needed, lately I've really been letting it go too far
and let them run everything.  I really struggle to allow them some time when
they need it, but setup good boundaries when its time.  Overall though I would
not trade being able to be with them everyday for anything.  It's hard, but I
completely appreciate that I am able to spend so much time with them throughout
each day.
