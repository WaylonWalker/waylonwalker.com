Today we washed our van... ourselves. In our journey to save all that we can we
are ditching the car wash and trying this out ourselves.  The results were
fantastic, it looks better than it does after a good automatic car wash, but
let me tell you it was some effort.  I think we can get the process down to
foam cannon and rinse and get similar quality for much less effort, but we full
detailed this exterior, windows, wheels, tires, the works.  I'll be interested
to see how it holds up over time.  Not sure that we are going to stick out this
cost savings measure, but we can at lease save a few months of washing during
the summer.
