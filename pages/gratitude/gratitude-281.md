Dad achievement unlocked, for her Birthday Ayla picked out a Nirvana sweatshirt
which she wore today, and people asked "oh you like Nirvana", her response was
Idk I never heard it before.  Tonight we sat down and she taught me how to make
bracelets while I taught her about a little known band out of Seattle
Washington from the late 80s.  Ironically enough when I sit down to do projects
lately with Wyatt (cyberbrick) we listen to Foo Fighters.

Later tonight Wyatt and I were out late after dark and we found comet Lemmon,
at least we think we did.  We were pretty late to the party and could have seen
it better days ago.  We found the Big Dipper and there was a faint glow over
the second star on the big dipper handle as described by his science teacher.
