Big day today!!! Movers are coming to box everything in our house!.  It
feels crazy but this move is about to happen.  We could sit back and
just tlet them do everything, but that is not our style.  I am too cheap
to let them do everything without me doing as much as I can, and
Rhiannon is too anxious to let them.  She also likes to save money, but
I dont think its in quite the frugal fashion as me.
