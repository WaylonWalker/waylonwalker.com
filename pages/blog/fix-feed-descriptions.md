Today I fixed a bug in markata that has been occurring for a few months where
the description for posts come out as None if coming from cache, the issue was
a pretty simple check and pull properly from cache.  This fixes all the
descriptions in feeds and metadata on the post.

## Better description

While in there we went ahead and improved our get_description to more
accurately return plain text without escaped characters, remove cutoff words,
and add an elipsis if the description cuts off the text.


## More description

While I was there I made longer form posts, `til, blog-post` use the super
description of 500 characters instead of the regular 120 character description.
