> Moore's Law is Dead pitches a pretty ingenious sku for the new gabecube aka steam machine.  I fully support repairability and ewaste reduction. most of these components have not had **MAJOR** improvements in years, hence his channel name.  There is a possibility here that Valve could ship with their unique hardware, (apu, psu, case, ports, networking) and let you bring your own ssd and ram from an old device that you might not use anymore.  I love this idea.  At the same time it feels like entering the star wars universe where there are no more new manufacturing and everything is cobbled together from old hardware made long ago.
