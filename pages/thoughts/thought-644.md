> Such a great message right now.  I feel like everywhere I turn is negativity, especially social media.  It feels like so many things are trying to divide and create hate.  "This" is what we should be doing with social media.  There are a lot of elements of "there are two ways to have the biggest building in town, tear down all the bigger buildings, or just build the biggest fucking building", If you want to be successful in X then surround yourself with others successful in X.  This is a catalytic skill that everyone needs to have in their belt.
