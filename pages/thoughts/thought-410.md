Helix officially made it in my devtainer.   I am installing the binary right out of the github release with wget and tar.  I can't use installer because their release format does not match what installer is looking for.  

!!! note: 
   I also move the runtime over to /usr/local/share/helix/runtime.

!!! note: 
   I use /usr/local/bin rather than my home directory as it works better with distrobox.

!!! note

    This post is a [[ thoughts | thought ]]. It's a short note that I make
