Last night we lined up a bunch of new houses to look at, still not
hearing back from the owners,  its frustrating, but we need to move so
we gotta start looking.

Tomorrow is a follow up appointment in Iowa City so we have a big day in
the car ahead of us.  With all the restrictions we don't really have
much chance to get out of the car.  It's a nervewracking day, getting
big news, with our kids sitting in the car for about 10 hours.  It's the
best way for us all to stay safe.  Last time the kids did fantastic
considering they have not been in the car at all in so long.  Hoping for
good news and a good trip ride with them.

Still got our fingers crossed on the house!
