Today was rehersal night for Ayla, I am so proud of her she seems to really be
thriving in the musical scene so far.  She auditioned on the day after
auditions on a lucky extra audition night that we happened to hear about hours
before, she went in there and did so well that they cast her into two roles.
She really has quite a confidence about her on stage.  I'm so proud of her
putting in the work every day of practice so far!
