> Great breakdown of nextjs.  I was highly unaware of its _performance_ optimizations before reading this.  The smell of vendor lock in from next/vercel has been there from the start, this is the first real claim I've seen.  

I'm out on modern js front ends, complex builds that change every 6 months, design patterns are out of date just as fast.  Its hard to keep up, especially when you don't have the use case for highly interactive apps.  Libraries like htmx or plain ol js gets the job done on the majority of sites and everything I tend to work on.
