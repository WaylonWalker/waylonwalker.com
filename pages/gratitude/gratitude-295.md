Final stretch of the year, wrapping up, and going through all of the goals and
evaluations.  This is one of my favorite times of the work year.  It's quiet.
There's less noise, less churn, less breaking.  There's a lot of time to jump
into special projects to set up and make next year better.  I've almost always
came out with some good end of year projects, this year is no different.  I
appreciate this wind down time.
