I have no experience in django, and in my exploration to become a better python
developer I am dipping my toe into one of the most polished and widely used web
frameworks Django to so that I can better understand it and become a better
python developer.

If you found this at all helpful make sure you check out the [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/)

## install django

The first thing I need to do is render out a template to start the project.
For this I need the `django-admin` cli.  To get this I am going the route of
`pipx` it will be installed globally on my system in it's own virtual
environment that I don't have to manage.  This will be useful only for using
startproject as far as I know.

``` bash
pipx install django
django-admin startproject try_django
cd try_django
```

## Make a venv

Once I have the project I need a venv for all of django and all of my
dependencies I might need for the project.  I have really been diggin `hatch`
lately, and it has a one line _"make a virtual environment and manage it for
me"_ command.

``` bash
hatch shell
```

If hatch is a bit bleeding edge for you, or it has died out by the time you
read this.  The ol trusty venv will likely stand the test of time, this is what
I would use for that.

``` bash
python -m .venv --prmpt `basename $PWD`
. ./.venv/bin/activate
```

## Start the webserver

Next up we need to start the webserver to start seeing that development
content.  The first thing I did was run it as stated in the tutorial and find
it clashed with a currently running web server port.

``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```

I jumped over to that tmux session, killed the process and I was up and running.

## What's running

The default django hello world looks well designed.  You are first presented
with this page.

## Next

I opened up the `urls.py` to discover that the only configured url was at
`/admin`. I tried to log in as admin, but was unable to as I have not yet
created a superuser.  Next time I play with django that is what I will explore.
