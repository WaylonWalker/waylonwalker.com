👋 Hi, I am Waylon Walker.  I Love creating things on the web, learning, and
teaching others.  I created my blogging platform from scratch to learn about
building tools with pluggy and diskcache.  I was frustrated with long build
times, black holes of node modules, bloated pages, and a lack of built in SEO
tools.

I am currently a Data Analytics team lead where I do a lot of code review, pair
programming, infrastructure, CI/CD, and devops.  I build data pipelines with
pandas and the fantasic kedro framework.
