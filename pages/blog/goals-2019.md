_The year of intenionality_

This is a follow up to my previous post [2018-retrospective](https://waylonwalker.com/2018-retrospective/)

## professional

This year I will become more productive, by intensionally working on a well thought out plan, learning the right technologies, and leave behind a positive legacy.

### Productivity

Last year I was able to make some great strides in my productivity and focus.  This year I want to be able to bring it up a notch.  **Intentionality** plays a big part in this.  Taking some time to sit down and think about the tasks you realistically want to complete for the day, then focusing on those tasks one at a time.

I started off the year last year using the **pomodoro** system to focus on one task and one task only for 25 minutes at a time.  This worked really well for me but I quickly fell off of the train and fell into my old trap of reacting to the loudest customer over the items I put **intensionally** on my todo list.

A **kanban** system is key to keeping it intentional.  I currently use a very simple trello system, with very few cards.  This helps to stay on track during those 25 minutes.  During the pomodoro session I move an item from todo, to doing, work that item, then move it to done when it is ready.  The only other thing that I can do during that time is to add items to the todo list.

* Daily session planning
    * Back on inbox zero
    * todo's go in kanban not inbox

### Leave a Legacy

I want to leave behind a legacy that I can be proud of. I want to be known for bringing a positive attitude that inspires others to do their best work, enourage others, and work as a team.  It is in my blood to help as many people as I can.  I am in a unique role and have a unique skill set that allows me to do what would take some hours and days in minutes and hours.  I really enjoy helping these folks, but I know many of them are smart enough to do it on their own, they just do not know where to get started.  For this reason I really want to amp up my docs this year.  I want people to be able to answer 80% of their questions right from the docs before needing to come to me to get started.  I want this to be part of the legacy that I leave with my projects for the next person that encounters them.

### Educational

Last year I made monumental improvements to my web development while continuing to hone my backend skills.  This year I want to amp up my web front end skills even more. I am finding this to be an area that not very many people in my organization have and I can knock out some simple projects really quick and gain a lot of value.  Last year I started using **react** as a front end framework.  I want to double down learning the intricicies of how it works, and how to effectively layout a react project. I also want to keep upping my design skills.  As I do more layouts I find that they are easier and easier to layout, and as I am able to get them out faster it give me more time to hone in the design. Lastly I want to continue honing in my backend skills.  Working with data pipelines, Linux command line, the cloud, and database architecture.

* Advanced React _dynamic web applications_
* Refactoring UI _Rethinking how to layout data in logical ways_
* Service Workies
* AWS?? _we are moving to the cloud_
* Continue Leveling up Linux Command Line
* Data Pipeline

## Personal

At home I want to continue being a positive person.  Home is much harder to keep up a good attitude.  Mostly because I care more about my family and its harder to walk away and forget about a bad interaction with them.  I want to make sure that we keep up more positive interactions together as that will help everyone keep the positive attitude.  Lastly I would like to keep in touch with family better.  Rhiannon really loves a nice message to boost her day.  I would like to send her a few longer messages per week, and to one other family member at least once per week.  This can be in the form of a text, email, or hard copy letter in the mail.
