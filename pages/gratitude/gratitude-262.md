What a heat wave we are getting hit with here, and it sneaks up on you.  I
Mowed the yard and thought I was doing well, but I'm definitely not conditioned
well for this heat anymore and I think it hit me harder than I'd like to admit.
Felt kinda crappy the rest of the day.  I'm grateful that I don't have to push
through and bear it out there, I can relax and go at whatever pace makes sense.
Rest of the day was chill, played games watched stuff with the family, Jett
wrapped up the 450 championship one round early, and Deegs takes it to the end.
