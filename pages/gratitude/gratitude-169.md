title: Gratitude 169

Tonight we started a new adventure into Blender.  It's something that Wyatt has
been asking about for a long time and we finally just did it.  I will say the
barrier to entry was way lower than I thought it would be.  Within minutes we
had it installed on both of our computers and were sculpting silly characters
out of virtual clay.  It was so fun.  I am so grateful for the tools that we
have available these days for cheap or free.  This type of software was far
from even possible when I was a kid and what was out there was not available to
kids.  I am excited to see him grow and stretch his muscles into game
development, simulation, digital art, or whatever may come of it.
