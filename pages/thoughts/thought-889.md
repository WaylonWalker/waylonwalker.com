> Age verification hitting bluesky?? At least its not yet requiring your govt issued id or anything, but stepping that direction.  I don't know how I feel about age checks, does it actually protect kids when parents aren't involved?  I can't say anything there, but it really does feel like its about ready to hurt the rest of us, requiring us to whip out ids and personal data for anything done online.  This is a real problem that is hard to solve, and reasons why it has not been solved yet.
