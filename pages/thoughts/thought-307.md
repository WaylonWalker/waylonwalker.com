> Currently Posting is a super early postman like tui (terminal user interface).  It looks so good.  Darren is really getting into a groove, and textual is getting to a place that is allowing him to really make these beautiful.

I am so impressed with the progress that he has made so early, it looks so close to postman in the freaking terminal, and the ui is so good.  He already has think like jump that give you a way to around the ui like easymotion plugins.  Theres themes and a command line, oh man its so good. star it.
