> This is a sick feature of Jim's blog, I am really inspired by this.  I am not sure how to do it for my own.  I honestly think the easiest non locked in way would be to just use google search console results.  It's definitely a different way to think about it, but most of my traffic is coming from google search, so it would be a pretty good ballpark estimate.
