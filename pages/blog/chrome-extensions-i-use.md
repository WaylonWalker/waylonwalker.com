There are many useful chrome extensions out there.  I probably have way too many installed, here are four that I am currently using.

This post was inspired from Chris over at [daily-dev-tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/top-10-chrome-extensions-for-developers-%F0%9F%91%80/)

1. [LastPass](#lastpass)
2. [Stylus](#stylus)
3. [Vimium](#vimium)
4. [hypothesis](#hypothesis)

## [LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en)

Love it or hate it passwords are hard to manage.  Everyone needs a password manager to avoid the dreaded password reuse, and to be able to quickly rotate them with a service.  I use lastpass, thus it's browser extension is my most used extension.

## [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)

Stylus is an extension that allows you to add your own CSS to style pages how you want.  There seems to be a full community of folks that really use this to the nth degree to style all of their commonly used sites somewhat similarly or add dark mode to sites without it.

Personally I mostly use it to add my favorite syntax highlighting theme to jupyter, **onedark**.  I've long lost the original author, but have posted the CSS I use in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/WaylonWalker/b082bda9c1ce1471ea0c940c836e5714)

## [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)

Vimium adds vim-like keybindings to chrome.  I don't use it a ton but it comes in handy to fully utilize the keyboard on some sites that aren't well suited to keyboard use.

## [hypothesis](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek?hl=en)

Hypothesis is a notetaking app that I am trying to get on board with.  I like that they have a REST API to get your notes from. It allows you to take notes or highlight web pages and share them easily.  I am still trying to remember to use this one more.

[![hypothesis](https://images.waylonwalker.com/chrome-extension-hypothesis.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek?hl=en)

These are my most used extensions.  What are yours?
