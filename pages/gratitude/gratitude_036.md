#### Special Time

This morning Wyatt came into our room just as normal, chipper as can be ready to go.  But something was different than normal.  I felt like I had just hit the pillow.  I grabbed a phone so that he could go watch something on his own, when I relized that it was 2:30AM.  This is not out of the ordinary for him to have a few days that he is ready to go.  We have learned that this is part of his ADHD and his mind is just running and ready to go.  Fighting  it only makes for starting off what could have been a good day on a bad note.  I let him go downstairs and he stayed quiet for the most part and let everyone sleep.  When I came down just before 6 he greeted me with cheer, let me have my coffee and we proceeded to have some special time.  We build with magnet tiles, legos, played a game, and even went outside to continue carving our path through the woods.  I cherish our special time together in happiness and am glad that we are learning to work with his disorder and have more good days like this.
