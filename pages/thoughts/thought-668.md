I've never heard of niri, or a scrolling window manager, it looks quite interesting.  I think tiling window manager misses out on named sessions and hotkey straight to tmux sessions, Brodi mentions not using tmux right before this segment.  Niri looks quite interesting, but looks like it suffers specificity.  maybe there are other tools that allow me to jump straight to something like brave, or steam, but I don't see how I could jump to a specific terminal.
