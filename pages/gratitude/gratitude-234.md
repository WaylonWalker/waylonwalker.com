Today wyatt and I had a boys day, while Rhiannon and Ayla went to the theatre
for a friends show.  We started off the day washing moms car, then going to D&D
camp after lunch.  From there we got lemonade from the gas station, and Wyatt
bless his heart is so grateful, we don't often go out and spend money on
extra things so the little things mean the world to him.  He told me the
whole ride home how much he appreciated it, how fun it was to go mix our own
drink at the fountain and how refreshing it was on such a hot day.  Then I
mowed while he jumped on the trampoline with the hose.  Afterwards I was so
hot we decided to go to the pool to cool off.  I am so grateful for these
days where we hang out and do a bunch of activities, they get very busy, but
they are the best, and very memorable.
