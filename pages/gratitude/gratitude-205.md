Today was DnD day for Wyatt, he is playing DnD at a local summer camp on
Sundays for the next few weeks and is having a great time with it.  While he
was there I walked around the park.  Its in the middle of a quite large park,
almost big enough to get lost in if you are not paying attention.  I started
following paved sidewalk trails, it quickly turned to covered sidewalks to
trees over sidewalks to patched up busted sidewalks.  It was like slowly
stepping into a long forgotten park, I could see other sections of sidewalk
accross the creek pushed up and snapped.  Some bridges in emacualte condition,
some completely gone.  I was a relaxing walk with nearly no more sound of the
city, everything was calm and quiet.  I am very grateful for this moment.
