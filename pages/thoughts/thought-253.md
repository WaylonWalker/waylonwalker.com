> Jerod (It's ya boi) and Adam are my favorite tech news nerds, and have the sickest podcasts in tech.  Yes plural podcasts they run seven podcasts maybe more.  If you want it short and sweet they got the best 15 minutes of tech news each week this is it.  My favorite is Ship it, sad to see Gerhard go, but Justin and Autumn are crushing it.  Every episode is highly polished and surrounded by the sickest beats in podcasting.

Subscribe to one pod if you want, but I recommend collecting them all with the master feed.
