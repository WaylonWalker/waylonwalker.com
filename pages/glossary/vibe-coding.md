A coding style popularized in 2025.  It is the act of using LLMs to generate
code for an application,  but the author never looks at the output.  The author
does not likely care about the output code, but is looking for a certain
result they can see.  This technique is highly criticised for large projects,
but has been proven effective for one off tasks that are not critical and the
result can be easily verified.

The term was coined by [karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy) in this
