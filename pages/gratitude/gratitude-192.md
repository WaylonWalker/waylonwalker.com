I am making some progress back on my open source projects.  Just this morning I
created a plugin that turns a markdown document into a set of slides on a
webpage just like my favorite terminal presentation tool lookatme does, except
in a web browser.  I really like the ability to create presentations in a
single markdown document its so quick and fluid.  I really like that I now have
another option to host them and include images.  Images is one of the few
things I was missing from lookatme, that I am no longer missing.
