> > Last year I attempted to do some newsletter-style link aggregation… that good intention imploded spectacularly. But I switched to Obsidian this month and now I have a better system for aggregating links (post on that coming later). Inside this issue you’ll find some games, some homelab server hardware, some AI discourse™, some musical instruments, and more.

This hits so close to home, I even went through the effort of making a weeknotes script, one weeknote post.  I also was inspired by obsidian but it didn't work out for me, so my script uses data from markata.
