Today I am grateful for this time I have everyday to sit with my thoughts from the previous day.   I take this time, a few minutes while in line at school pickup, to gather my thoughts and journal.  A time that used to be despised of early in our journey as parents, now it is a time that I've found as a part of a ritual, its part of my routine.  It's found purpose in my life, within the next couple of years this time will change, and we will need to move on.  It seems so far away, yet its' much closer to the end han the beginning.  Everything has a finite time, nothing lasts forever, change is hard.  Sometimes change has unintended consequenses.  I've not always kept up the habbit of daily journaling, I've had spots where it doesn't happen for a day here and there, and spots where months maybe year long gaps.  But this journal started here, in this line, waiting for the specific window in time where kids are let out and they grace us with the story of their day.  They let us know everything that was important to them throughout the day.  This time will be lost eventually, and with that change.  Through that change will find new routine, new opportunities for habbits good and bad to develop fresh.  For now I will be grateful to continue this routine day in and day out.
