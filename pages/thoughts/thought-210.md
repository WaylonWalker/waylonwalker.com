This is the best tree I have ever built in minecraft.  It took at least 4 stacks of logs and leaves despite what it looks like.

It is placed where Welscraft's island in the hermitcraft season 10 seed, but on our own server we call lonecraft.

We started this server a few weeks after hermitcraft season 10 started, and play on it a few times per week.  It has a pretty successful day one iron farm that took us way more than one day to complete, and the farm behind this is our first ever villager driven farm.  Somehow potatoes got cross contaminated and now its pumping out potatoes and some bread, but no carrots or beat roots.
