Today the kids and I went to a new park before heading to Annie Jr. rehearsal,
it was a fun adventure for us to get out and explore a new park.  Sadly Wyatt
Tripped on a cement slab and completely scraped his shin from ankle to knee, it
looks rough.  I am so grateful for Ayla pushing us to discover new things.  She
really pushes us to get out, but a lot of times she tries to do it for things
that cost money that we don't have to spend right now.

While at Annie Jr. drop off there is a kid with Downs syndrome in it, and when
she arrive she came out of her car with such forceful excitement to be with her
friends it was amazing.  And all of the other kids cheered and welcomed her to
the playground while waiting.  It was really cool to see how accepting the kids
are for her, but just her pure joy she brought running out of the car and on to
the playground.
