Inspired by [Justin Searls Shots](https://justin.searls.co/shots/), I made
started [my own shots feed](https://waylonwalker.com/shots/) for self hosted
Instagram style photos.  The layout could use a lot of work, the feed seems
like its breaking on rebuild due to some cache issues, but its there and kind
of works and eventually will get a proper prominently placed link, for now its
an idea for anyone who sees this.

> By the way what a boss domain searls.co is.  I've seen Chris Coyier just got
> [coyer.com](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/07/01/coyier-com/) and talked about
> being able to use it as a family domain.
