I had an idea come to me via twitter. Short one word name packages are becoming
hard to find on pypi.  Short one word readable package names that are not a
play on words are easy to remember, easy to spell correctly, and quick to type
out.

## Simple index

I started with the simple index.  Pypi provides a single page listing to every
single package hosted on pypi via the [simple-index](https://pypi.org/simple/)
