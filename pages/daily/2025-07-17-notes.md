TIL [[ pygments-htmlformatter ]] is a big win for [[ markata ]], didn't have a
chance to take notes yesterday, but I'm really working on templates and themes.
It's becoming more important for me as I get more users, i.e. family members
blog sites up and running.  No one wants to look default, they all want to look
unique, learning how to change out themes like this is a good win.

Still working on searchcraft integrations and holy shit is it fast.  I'm
searching and scrubbing through logs out of cloudwatch at 2ms/search rather
than their dogwater 30s+ broken ui not loading, not showing me the logs I want.
This is not even apples to apples, cloudwatch chokes on one job worth of logs,
I've got 500 jobs of logs and searchcraft is eating them up like nothin.
