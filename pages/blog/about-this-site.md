I registered waylonwalker.com and started making content for it in 2017 after a
big industry downturn in 2016 that left me scared for what would happen if I
were laid off.  The company I was working for at the time did it's first major
downsizing in history sending many really good engineers out to look for new
opportunities in a world flooded with many in the same situation.  This was
very similar to what happened to the tech industry in 2024.

## What is this site?

* TIL
* portfolio
* my personal corner of the internet

## It's NOT{.text-red-500 font-bold text-2xl} Perfect

* There will be mistakes
* I will learn
* Grammar will be fine, but never perfect
* Code will run on my machine, but not guaranteed to be perfect
* There will be days when the whole site is broken

## It's a blog

This site started out as a big B Blog.  It was me trying to learn how to write
and build content online.  This content was to the best of my ability polished
and complete.  Posts took a long time to make.  I liked working on it, but
sometimes ideas came faster than I could explore an idea polish the content and
publish it.

## It's a digital garden

Somewhere along the line I found a really great community of people who create
content in ways that they does not require that level of depth and polish on
each and every post they make.  Ideas flow out and content gets made over time.

[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) and the idea of [digital
gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) has been very
inspiriational. She makes really great content with amazing drawings in them.
She publishes early and often and labels content with the state that it is in,
early and often.  Some posts are budding, and some are evergreen.  She also
distinguishes between notes and essays.

## Learn in public

[Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) (swyx) Has been very inpsiring with ideas
around [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

Try your best to be right but don't wait til your the expert to share what you
are learning.  If something works for you, you are likely mostly right even if
you don't have all the right words for it yet.  Don't be afraid to be wrong.

## TIL

On to one of the most inspirational pieces that I have taken ideas from
[@jbrancha](https://x.com/jbrancha) [#til
repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).  He has been posting daily Tils
for Years, and they do pretty damn well on google despite what SEO experts say
his results end up in my google search quite often.

I've made many posts on this site in the TIL format.  I don't strictly stick to
a schedule or a character length quite like Josh Does, but generally they are
short, sweet, single ideas.

## Thoughts

I created a sub site [[ thoughts ]] to serve as a sort of list of bookmarks,
its a place for me to comment, quote, and link to other pages on the internet.

## Portfolio

This is my place to create and share content that becomes part of my portfolio.
I network with others, share content across social accounts and make it public.
This is an example of my work in writing, documenting, mentoring, and web
development.

## Static Site

This site has gone from html, to gatsby, and finally I built my own static site
generator [[ markata ]].  It's been through a few different hosts, but at the
end of the day the content is all
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) with frontmatter.

For instance the beginning of this post looks like this.

## Own your Content

Throughout this process I have become a proponent of owning your own content on
the internet.  If you own the domain, the content, and host it yourself you
control when it gets published, deleted, and updated.  No one can take this
away from you execept for you.  It's a very powerful tool that I highly
recommend everyone to use.  You can get your own domain for $12/year or less,
and that is all you need to pay.
