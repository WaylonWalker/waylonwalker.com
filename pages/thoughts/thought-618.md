> This episode really got me thinking about the difference between HA and DR and my approach to each one.  They talk about it from the perspective of a cach cow kind of app rather than a homelab or internal tooling, but think of HA as 9's how many 9s are we willing to pay for, tink of DR as dollars how many dollars will we loose during the period of recovery.  So much more in the episode, a lot of talk around cloud vendors and what they give you vs a purpose build platform with HA and DR in mind.
