An absolute fantastic episode about blogging, thinking about a web1.0 kind of world today, and what it means moving forward.

Web 1.0 is robust, you own your own destiny, you own your data, you can do what you want.  There is no platform to tell you what you can and cannot do.  But the future web is stealing your data to build AI models, spam sites are duplicating your content and stealing your SEO.  You may or may not care, but at the end whether you get traffic or now you own your web 1.0 sites.
