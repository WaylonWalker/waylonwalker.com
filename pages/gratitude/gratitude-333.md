Hello Happy  Friday, today is a Friday half day at school. Kids will be home early and ready for a big V-day weekend.

This mornings dev meeting was a super productive one squashing a task that's been on the board for months.  It was a get everyone in the same room and go through a GIANT list kind of thing.

Last night I took the kids out to get special drinks from Culvers as a reward for Ayla's great babysitting play time at theater.  Then Made Rhiannon and I some Teriyaki Chicken and Rice, turned out fantastic, glad to have this quick and easy recipe in the tool belt.  Wish we had more vegetables on hand to go with it, but I cannot complain.

Now the biggest win from yesterday, I went to a workout with Rhiannon and finished with her.  I hit all the reps.  I went low on the resistance to make sure that I could make it through.  My lack of ability to stretch really came in to hurt me here, there were a few moves like behind the head/back that my arms really struggle to get into, really highlighting my need for a good stretch routine.  Overall so happy to finish and get through it, Rhiannon has been asking me to join in on one for months, but it never works out with Work and things we have going on in life.
