It's back to school busy lately, getting kids stuff ready for school, changing
routine, getting kids out the door on time, picked up on time, it gets a little
wild, every parent goes through this.  I am so grateful that Rhiannon does such
an impecible job navigating the school and getting all of their stuff lined up
on time for the start of school.  I do a pretty good job of getting into the
routine and running the checklist every day, but its the initial communication
with the school, going through all the lists, figuring out what they
want/like/need that is just not my specialty, but Rhiannon does a great job at
it and I am so grateful to have her.
