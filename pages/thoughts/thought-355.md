> This is a wild keyboard test.  This is exactly what I want to see from ticklemykeys.com.  I want to make ergomechanical boards that you can use and abuse.  I want you to not be afraid to take them with you or to eat a nutrigrain bar in the same room (cough 2015 mac).  And If something does go out, I want users to be able to repair it themsleves, key caps, switches, batteries, and microcontrollers should be replacible parts they can get at a good cost from the shop if they have paid for a board.
