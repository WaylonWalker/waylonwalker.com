> I'd never given this much thought, but there are so many guides that are complete guides for beginner workflows, but once you get beyond beginner there is likely no manual for what you are trying to do in programming.  There is no guide that will tell you the best way to get your companies salesforce data, alongside of the ERP data and present it to the users who need to know in a way that compels them to make the right decisions.  You are going to have to build this out for yourself by piecing together knowledge about each subject.
