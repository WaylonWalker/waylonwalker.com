> I didn't realize that postiz had a helm chart, I just hand rolled mine based on the compose file they provide.  I went from running the compose stack locally to running in my homelab with kubernetes.  I am using cnpg rather than a postgres container which I really like the workflow of as far as backup and restore.  The one hiccup I ran into was changing the domain from localhost to my homelab domain killed all of my integrations and they needed the redirect url updated.
