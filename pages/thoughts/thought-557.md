Damn prime makes an interesting point near then end of this video.  He's seen a bunch of people able to just throw down charts and shit at their company and end up being "the coding guy" cause they proompted something once.  In a way I can relate, I got into software in a similar way, but at a time that it took a lot more hard work, understanding , and copy past from the right stack overflow.   Based on some of the people around me at the time I can only imagine how some people must feel like they got pushed into it without wanting it, and now are building something they don't know anything about with no care about it or care to build any expertise.  Is the future proompted charts from enterprise chatgpt or do we only continue growing more need for software from here.
