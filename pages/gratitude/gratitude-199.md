A few weeks back we took a trip back to my family farm and Rhiannon took this
amazing picture of the two of us.  We all had a great time, it was just a quick
afternoon trip, we got there as the sun was setting, did some fishing and a
ranger ride.  I am so glad that we were able to do it.  On the ride home, we
almost ran out of juice, but made it home on E.
