Let the home buying process begin!  Just a few days ago we thought our
only option was to continue renting for yet another lease, and here we
are today working with what seems like a fantastic mortgage company and
realator trying to figure out what we want in a house.  I think we are
just at the point where we would like to be in just a bit better
situation before purchasing, but at the same time, we are done getting
kicked to the street or needing to upgrade every 1-2 years we have
currently lived in 6 different Addresses in the last 10 years, let's
hope the next 10 have much fewer than this.
