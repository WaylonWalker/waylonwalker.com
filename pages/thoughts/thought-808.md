Damn, social media is at an all time low.  I've felt all of these issues and when I got a new phone I started fresh, I didn't install one social media app.  Luckily Youtube has remained solid for me.  Yes shorts are a bit less what I came for and more addicting content they _had_ to do in order to keep up.  There are some legit good commedians, a bit of good knowledge and a bunch of trash that is hard to look away from on shorts.  I still find myself able to find content I enjoy and signed up for on YouTube.  I feel like I get a one way relationship with someone similar to a TV show or news anchor of old media.

Social Media has morphed from follows likes and similar, to viral posts by creators I don't recognize.  posting and immediately getting like by two **hot** women with accounts created this week.  The rest of the real creators left on there are stuck trying to keep up, echo viral trends, trying to keep up the content treadmill.   A few come through, but most feel somewhat forced.  A lot of it is ai generated, and whats not mostly doesn't feel that human anyways.

The people on here seem to really tie the internet to social media and are ready to quit the internet.  I think there is more to the internet, we can find each other, but setting up rss feeds, following others, and scrolling their own website lacks that dopamine hit social media has right now.
