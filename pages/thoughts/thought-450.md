Cheers to the Unique brains dave.  I can say I am 100% with Dave on all of these, except the clean environment thing, lucky Dave.  If I have enough room to see what I am doing and walk around a mess, I probably wont even notice it.  I'm so hyper focused on what is right in front of me that mess could be a huge pile of cash and i'd never see it.
