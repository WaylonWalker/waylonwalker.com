Both kids sleeping in past 7am this morning who dis.  I am so proud of those
two for putting in so much hard work for the musical.  They haven't slept in
this late in years, usually up by 5-5:30am.  These later nights mixed with hard
work has them wiped.  It's really good to see everyone working towards a common
goal.
