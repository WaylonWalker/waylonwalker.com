In python data science we often will reach for pandas a bit more than
necessary. While pandas can save us so much there are times where there are
alternatives that are much simpler.  The itertools` and `more-itertools` are
full of cases of this.

This post is a walkthrough of me solving a problem with `more-itertools` rather
than reaching for a for loop, or pandas.

I am working on a  one-line-link expander for my blog.  I ended up doing it,
just by modifying the markdown with python.  I first split the post into lines
with `content.split('\n')`, then look to see if the line appears to be just a
link.  One more safety net that I wanted to add was to check if there was
whitespace around the line, this could not simply be done in a list
comprehension by itself.  I need just a bit of knowledge of the surrounding
lines, enter `more-itertools`.

## simplified rendering function

I have a function that will check to see if the line should be expanded, then
render the correct template.  Fist step is to check if the line contains no
spaces and starts with `https`, if it
does render the template.

The real expand_line function uses requests to pull some metadata about the
post to insert into the card, more on that in another post.

``` python
def expand_line(line):
   """
   Check if line should be expanded then render a template
   """

   if ' ' in line and line.startswith('https'):
      return line

  return f"<a href='{line}' class='card'>"
```

## initial implementation

My first implementation was to load in the content as a single string and use a
list comprehension to expand each line.

``` python
expanded_content = "\n".join(
    [expand_line(line) for line in content]
)
```

## The issue

Sometimes I write my posts in vim without wordwrap on and just use `gq` to wrap
them to the current `textwidth`.  If I have a link that happens to be really
long it ends up on its own line.  I do not want one line links to expand if
they are in the middle of a paragraph.

``` markdown
## sample paragraph

This is a paragraph that has a really long link
[[ not-a-real-link-just-a-silly-example-for-this-post ]]
inside of it that ends up on its own line
```

> I need a bit of knowledge about the lines around the link.

## windowing

`more-itertools` comes with a windowing function that will slide over an
iterable with a width of n.

``` python
>>> from more_itertools import windowed
>>> all_windows = windowed([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
>>> list(all_windows)
[(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5)])]
```

> docs](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.windowed)

## sliding through my content

The one extra that we need is padding at the front and back of the list so that
we ensure that every value ends up in the middle position at least once.

``` python
expanded_content = "\n".join(
    [expand_line(*line) for line in windowed(f'\n{content}\n', 3)]
)
```

achieve.

    <h2>understanding python *args and **kwargs</h2>
    <p class="description">
    Python `*args` and `**kwargs` are super useful tools, that when used properly can make you code much simpler and easier to maintain.  Large manual conversions from a dataset to function arguments can be packed and unpacked into lists or dictionaries. Beware though, this power **can** lead to some really unreadable/unusable code if done wrong.

## update expand_line

Now that we are calling `expand_line` with all three lines.  We need to update
the function signature and add a guarding clause to return early if before or
after lines are not blank.

``` python
def expand_line(before, line, after):
   """
   Check if line should be expanded then render a template
   """
    if before != '' and after != '':
      return line


    if ' ' in line and line.startswith('https'):
      return line

    return f"<a href='{line}' class='card'>"
```

`more-itertools`, If you learned something be sure to share it.
