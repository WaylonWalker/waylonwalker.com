Kinda mindblown that this is even possible.  This is so far outside of my current thinking that i didn't even think of an elegant way to implement semantic search accross images and text at the same time.  I know it happens at Google, but I envision that as still text search accross tags and meta data about the image.

Based on the number of responses CLIP is the thing that does this.
