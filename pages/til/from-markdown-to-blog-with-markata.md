Markata is a great python framework that allows you to go from markdown to a
full website very quickly.  You can get up and running with nothing more than
Markdown.  It is also built on a full plugin architecture, so if there is extra
functionality that you want to add, you can create a plugin to make it behave
like you want.

Full transparancy... I built markata.

## The talk

The talk is live on YouTube.  Make sure you check out the other videos from the
conference.  There were quite a few quality talks that deserve a watch as well.
