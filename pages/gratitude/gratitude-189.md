Tonight I played power washing simulator with Rhiannon.  She was playing with
wyatt before he went to bed.  When he was sleepy I took over to finish up the
fire station level with her.  I really enjoyed it.  It has been quite awhile
since we have played a video game together.  I absolutely love playing with the
kids, but it was fun to have a change in pace and do something different with
her.
