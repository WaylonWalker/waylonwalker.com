> Diun, looks like a very interesting tool to monitor for image updates, it does not make any change, it only makes notifications.  This feels like an easy start to getting image updates started with low effort, keep git ops, but requires manual updates.  I see this as a tool that would be a great start and pair well with automated image updaters to ensure they are working as expected.
