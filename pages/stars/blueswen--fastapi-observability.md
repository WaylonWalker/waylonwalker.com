I'm really excited about [fastapi-observability](https://github.com/blueswen/fastapi-observability), an amazing project by [blueswen](https://github.com/blueswen). It's worth exploring!

Observe FastAPI app with three pillars of observability: Traces (Tempo), Metrics (Prometheus), Logs (Loki) on Grafana through OpenTelemetry and OpenMetrics.
