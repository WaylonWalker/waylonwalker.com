My son and I are starting a new Minecraft server today called wondercraft.

## spawn

We initially spawned in a plains biome near an acacia and forest biome.

## Night one Zombie fight

On the first night we had the obligitory zombie fight before getting beds and bases set.

## Salmon Wrangler

I was the designated food provider.  I setup a small wheat farm with about 64
seeds, then went out to hunt down some salmon for the immediate food need.  I
ended up with about a stack of salmon at the end of the session.
