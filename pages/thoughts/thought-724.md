> vim usage is becoming normie level.  Just like `archinstall` made it too easy to install arch and brought normies into the ecosystem.  It killed ArchBTW^TM^, distros like lazyvim have killed vimBTW^TM^.  It used to be that to run arch, vim, nvim you had to read the docs, and go deep on understanding.  running `archinstall`or lazyvim make it so easy to get started that you miss all of the details, you no longer have to understand ctags, quickfix, what an lsp is, or even how to set your own keybindings.  You just use the damn thing, like you would with VSC****.  No shame to anyone who does this, but you are probably missing out on a bunch of really useful features of a very core tool in your workflow.

Just discovered Sylvan Franklin in this post and he is cracked, sub now.
