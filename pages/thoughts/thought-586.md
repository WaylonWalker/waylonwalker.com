> Damn he makes this easy.  I did not know about `hx-select`.  yes there is waste in requesting the entire thing every 5s, but damn that was easy to get life reload.  I've only done very specific backend endpoints, built pages up from partials, made endpoints for partials.  keeping this one in my back pocket.

I'm just kind of amazed that he could do this all in html without touching the backend or js, typically things like this require one or the other.  Yes js is running, but no other js library I'm aware of lets you do this.
