What a great campfire story Casey stumbled into.  Whether any of this is true few will ever know, but its very reasonable that a race condition and a stalled job to apply configuration caused by someone who left the company 10 years ago caused an outage.  I find it hilarious that they call this guy he answers, yup I still know the password, but how do I know you're legit, I'm not just handing out the password.  Casey did a stand up job telling this story.
