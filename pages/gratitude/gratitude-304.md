Final day of 2025, we have all been pretty sick for about a week now.  It's nice not to have to work through it, but definitely not getting the  things done we wanted to.  I started pushing through to get a new keyboard built.  I want a similar pair for work and home.  My work one is very sticky from some resin in a few switches.  I really like that board.  It's a low profile and feels really good, it just has a few quirks.  Glad to be able to start building it's replacement.
