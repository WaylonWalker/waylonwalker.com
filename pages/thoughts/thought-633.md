> Ultimately though a business needs a product. Textual has always been a solution in search of a problem. And while there are plenty of problems to which Textual is a fantastic solution, we weren't able to find a shared problem or pain-point to build a viable business around. 

I can totally see this. Finding a marketable business idea is not easy, working in the developer space where everyone wants to do it themselves is no better.  Textual specifically I could see, I really wanted to build things on it as it came out, I had ideas, it was hard to use at the time and changing, so I took a break, got busy with far too many other things, and really I 'm good with rich most of the time.

I daily use k9s, its absolutely amazing at what it does and appreciate that I could build something like it in python, its just hard to justify the time investment for the things I tend to work on.

Damn, that hit hard, its been an adventure watching textual get built, things like posting look fantastic!  Glad to see that its still alive with open source and Will is not leaving, but there will be no company.  This likely means significanly less velocity, but it might mean that not being tied to making money other opportunities open up.


Thanks for giving us amazing terminal products Will.
