file over app is a fantastic philosophy laid out well and concisely documented very well in this post.  The idea is that tools will change, we will want to use different tools, different editors, different computers over time.  What's likely to outlast everything is plain text files that we can interact with a wide variety of tools.  Not encrypted in dedicated formats that die with our tools, but in plain text where a computer from 2160 is likey as capable of reading the file as one from 1960 would be.
