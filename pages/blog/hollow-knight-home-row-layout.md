I just made it past 100% in my main hollow knight run, so now I will allow
myself to get silksong when it comes out.  I did this with a little bit of YT
guidance, but mostly just figuring it out.  I only just discovered the
[[reznormichael-hollow-knight-completion-check]] which got me an extra 2% for
a few items I must have got and not saved on, because I was sure I had them.

## Controller

Hollow Knight is a game that can be played with keyboard or controller, You can
use analog stick for movements, but they just translate to dpad, there really
are no analog moves in the game.  This makes it ripe for playing on pure
keyboard.  I really favor controller when there are more than one analog
(throttle, brake, steering for example).

On controller I've switched to only using d-pad as I feel like it gives me the
most crisp of controls.  It is really easy to miss a pogo on analog by hitting
slightly left or right.

## My Keyboard

My daily driver keyboard is a custom built 40% monoblock keyboard I absolutely
love using it, it perfectly plops down on a laptop when I am in laptop mode and
really fits me quite well for my wrok as a software/infrastructure engineer.

## WASD

_We've got to talk about pinky stagger_

I can use wasd perfectly fine on it, I have a layer that has no holds on any
keys so that they are all nice and crisp and tailored to gaming operations that
would require a hold.

Now what I haven't ran into before is that trying to game with wasd and use the
right side is very uncomfortable with this steep of a pinky stagger.  Generally
with keyboard an mouse games I have the keyboard a little slanted and move my
fingers to wasd just fine, but it just does not work well with both hands on
the keyboard.

## Enter asdf

Today is day one, I'm not quite sure how long it will last, but I am giving
asdf a try for arrow keys.  This will work much more akin to a fight stick
where each finger has a primary direction instead of using one finger for both
up and down.

!!! Note vim keys, but mirrored
    I chose to mirror vim keys with down towards the middle.  I had it the other
    way, but when I played, I kept pressing it the other way.

    * a - left
    * s - up
    * d - down
    * f - right

!!! Note power keys
    I wanted to put the most common keys on the strongest finger (feels like
    left pinky breaks this mantra, but whatever).

    * j - attack
    * k - dash
    * l - focus/cast
    * h - quick cast
    * e - inventory
    * u - super dash
    * m - map
    * g - dream nail

## This seems weird

So Ya, I know it's weird. I did some searching wasn't able to find much other
than this one [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/18kdnl0/using_asdf_instead_of_wasd_for_gaming/)
talking about using asdf.  oddly one person reccommended sdfg, this souds so
much like vim, which makes a lot of sense, but brings back moving fingers off
of home row position or using one finger for down and right, which aint gonna
work.

## First thoughts

I'm about 20 minutes in and struggling on False Knight, I could be a bit more
patient, but I'm trying to work on pogos on all the mobs on the way in.

### Holding up or down

The ability to just hold up or down as you run through the map with enemies
coming from above or below feels superior, and its going to be nice, I really
just got to put some time in to get use to the layout, maybe even make some
changes.

I realize now that Hollow Knight rarely needs quick swiching between up and
down and would probably be fine on a wasd layout if i were to be using a split
keyboard or a bit less pinky stagger that would work out, but for now I am
giving this a shot.

## My Son's experience

So my son is playing along with me, new save as well. He went with wasd and
mouse, while this sounds insane to me to use mouse for clicking and no movement
the natural feel that it has, has him blazing through faster than he does on
controller, doing pogos he's never done before.

## False Knight down

The recording somehow stuck on the menu screen and did not record video, but I
got this screenshot of the victory.

## Vengeful Spirit

Day 2 I managed to make it to the Ancestral Mound and get the Vengeful Spirit
cast.  Everything is starting to feel much better and more natural.
Surprisingly my main issue is with up and down since they are used a bit less,
left with my pinky has not been any issue.

## Hornet Battle 1

I made it successfully through the first hornet battle I was able to snag this
clip of a few nicely timed pogos.  Its getting better, I am still really
struggling between down srike and up strike.

![hollow-knight-keeb-run-hornet-pogos.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/f627cb2c-8da5-4508-9d05-c3a12ed4c2b9.mp4)

## Mothwing Cloak

I got so lucky  with the finish of hornet, I thought she hit me while healing,
kinda lost where we were tanked a hit and almost took one last hit again and
beat her to the final punch.

![hollow-knight-keeb-run-hornet-finish.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/d8784c22-2baa-410a-af23-d7ebebaa6608.mp4)

## Gruz Mother

After completing gruz mother I went to grab my macropad to click the clip
button when her babies came out, and it was at this moment my son told me I was
done for, there was no recovering from this.  I was already at 2 hearts, and a
mistake left me with one.  You can see me fumble for the up key in the clip as
I get repositioned fully on back on the board.

![hollow-knight-keeb-run-gruz-mother.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/0a6ffb43-f416-46e4-9e17-05c3ac9c3429.mp4)

Now we have Sly the merchant unlocked and can buy items from him.

## City

I made it to the city, but on my way, it looks like one of the smokey layers
were getting put on top of the game instead of layer in behind. I've never seen
this, so I really have no idea what it is.  During the thorny area it was in
and out and right as I entered the city it locked on top and did not leave.

![image](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/f2fe3da0-9078-4292-9fef-9f4efd306d63.webp)

## Soul Master

I made my way over to the soul master, dying several times along the way to a
few [Soul Twisters](https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Twister), its
time to battle.

![hollow-knight-keeb-run-soul-meeting-master.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/2d664476-ac45-4461-8e33-43211d493e9e.mp4)

After beating his second room, (this clip makes him look way too easy as he
wasn't targeting me fore some reason at the end), I picked up desolate dive,
which brings a new key combo to get familiar with down+cast.

![hollow-knight-keeb-run-soul-master-finish.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/af9df166-33cd-4260-85df-910e8a18116c.mp4)

## Moss Knight

I took a break for awhile on the game, my son got bored and moved on.  He tends
to switch out games a lot faster than me.  I came back to it tonight after a
few months off and just got some geo from the moss knights for awhile.  I got
this decent clip of clearing them, I'm no pro, but getting better at timing on
the keeb layout.

![hollow-knight-keeb-moss-knight.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/d8571451-7a1e-4997-85eb-b5ce2cfdc209.mp4)

## Lumafly Lantern

While I had a lot of geo from the Moss Knights I finished out getting 1800 geo
to get the lumafly lantern from sly's shop at dirtmouth.

![hollow-knight-keeb-lumafly-lantern.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/2ea5790c-66d7-401d-95c7-c81a2bccb743.mp4)

## Royal Waterway

I decided to head back to the city of tears and into the royal waterway to
fight the dung defender and collect Isma's tear.

![hollow-knight-keeb-royal-waterway-unlock.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/3713bdd1-c645-46c5-85d2-451356383842.mp4)

![hollow-knight-keeb-royal-waterway-entering.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/58235f4d-701f-4ddc-a26d-ab5f9e0bdbfc.mp4)

![hollow-knight-keeb-royal-waterway-bench.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/bdf1985b-6a32-4bf4-9f9a-d6f814db7136.mp4)

The Dung Defender battle, great lore with this guy, lots of bouncy movement,
but overall not too hard of a boss.  He is not very accurate with attacks, so
you have time to just sit in the corners and heal.

![hollow-knight-keeb-dung-defender.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/982091a0-a65a-44a4-aca6-fbffcff9ed90.mp4)

Once the Dung Defender was defeated, I continued on up to the Kings Station and unlocked it.

![hollow-knight-keeb-kings-station.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/3651c0e1-6d99-4b54-95eb-5b955323a2e9.mp4)

I could not remember where ismas tear was and I ended up all the way down in
deep nest, the climb out is a bit of a challenge, here I am going right by the
route you take with crystal dash to get isma's tear.

![climbing-out-of-deep-nest.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/9a4befef-e694-4a3c-8b0e-edd06a3f741c.mp4)

## Isma's Tear

I managed to find my way through the royal waterway and where you crystal dash
over to isma's tear.  This battle took two attempts, because the first I had no
health left and walked in with two masks.

![hollow-knight-keeb-ismas-tear-battle.mp4](https://dropper.wayl.one/api/file/4dd7d2cd-7d4a-473e-a483-f8f8512c6442.mp4)

Now the tear coats our shell and allows us to swim through the acid, and we can
get a lot more places, and some places are just easier to get without precision
parkour over the acid.

## Thorny Mask

I wandered around the world a bit today and found a few small items, nothing of major concequence.
