This is definitely happening to my secretlabs chair.  I did the fix this morning, its still not perfect, but it's better now than it has been in a long time.  Mine use to be so bad that it would pop and creak every time I sat down or moved the smallest bit.  It's now quiet through the mid range of its motion with the occasional pop when I sit down.
