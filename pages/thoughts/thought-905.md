I thought this was an interesting take from Simon.  I've been hearing him consistently say there will be more demand for software engineering in the future.  More companies will have the ability and need to deal with software applications, but fewer of us will be hand editing any code.  I thought this was an interesting interaction in the clip.

> Uh Simon, what do you got for us? 

> I've just got the one. I think the act


> of the the the job of being paid money to type code into a computer Yeah.


> will go the same way as punching punch cards. 

> Okay. 

> I do I think in


> six years time I do not think it will anyone will be paid to 80:56
just do the thing where you type the code. 

> Just type the code. Okay. 

> I
think software engineering will still be an enormous career. I just think the
software engineers won't be spending multiple hours of their day in a text
editor typing out syntax. 81:09 

> It will look like punching cards. I think
so. Yeah. 

> Yeah. Interesting. In uh in six years. Um and but software
engineering still very much exists. 

> I believe so. I I hope so. [laughter] I
very much hope so because I think 

> the um the challenge of being a software
81:23 engineer is not remembering 

> how if what what if what for loops look
like. It is understanding what computers can do and how to turn fuzzy human
requirements into actual like working software. And that's that's what we're
for. And I think we'll still be doing that just a lot more of it in a lot more
ambitious scale. 

> And then Okay. Do you Does the software engineer though
deals with code? I mean they I mean the code is being written. 

> I think
they probably look at it occasionally. 

> Okay. Only occasionally a little
bit. So I met 81:53 

> Who debugs it? 

> Um I I hate to say it, the agents
debug it themselves. 

> Okay. Who debugs your device driver that either works
or doesn't? I like 

> working on this programming language like I'm doing my
own codegen and like 

> claude is happy to pull out GDB and just like
