Today I had my first and final physical therapy
appointment for my knee.  It went really well. I went to
one that we really trust, and he was able to asure me that
everything was healing and looking well.  He told me what
to look out for and what to do to keep healing the right
way.  I am just go grateful that everything has turned out
well from this simple accident that could have been even
worse.
