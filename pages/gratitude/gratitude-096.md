##  Chemo day

Today was the every 3 week chemo therapy day for my wife.  Today I am grateful
that it all went well and that she got her favorite nurse, Dee, to administer
it.  They have a really great relationship, and it makes me feel great for
Rhiannon to have such a companion through this.  Even though I am still not
able to get into the cancer center due to COVID-19 restrictions I feel that she
is well taken care of.

> Thank you Dee we appreciate you so much
