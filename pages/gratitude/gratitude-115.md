Today we started cleaning up some more things in the garage, quite
casually.  I was quite impressed at what a great helper Wyatt was, he
was stying on task for quite some time, vaccuuming up some things, and
folding up boxes.  It's quite the growth for him to be able to focus on
something for very long at all.
