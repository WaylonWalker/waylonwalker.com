There is a glimmer of hope out there that normal people can scrap together enough gpu to really run the latest models themselves.  The ui really appears to be having huge leaps forward such that doing things like rag is no longer such a research project that it was just a few years ago.  So excited to see Prime go through this homelab exercise.
