Discovered the Brutalist Report from [CJ](https://coding.garden/) on [syntax.fm](syntax.fm) on their [rss-is-not-dead](https://syntax.fm/show/926/rss-is-not-dead) episode.  The way he described it, I was like gnaw thats whack, not into it, but I had to check it out.  It's actually great!  Except the political shit, I go to rss to get away from political finger pointing.  The Hacker News list is great, maybe I need to pay more attention to hacker news??
