After years of listening to [talkpython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/) I had the
honor to be part of
[episode-337](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/337/kedro-for-maintainable-data-science)
to talk about Kedro for maintainable data science.

I was quite nervous to talk on a show that I helped shape my career in such a
profound way. I started my journey towards software engineering near Michaels
first few episodes. His discussions with such great developers over the years
has made an huge impact on my skill. It has always given me great advice and
topics to go deeper on.

During the episode I tried my best to let Yetu and Ivan take the spotlight as
the maintainer and chime in with my experience as a user of kedro.
