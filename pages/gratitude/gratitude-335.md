Oh the weather outside is getting nice, its time to go out and enjoy, folic in the breeze.  We are in the magical few weeks between hot and cold right now.  I came home today to help support Rhiannon and make lunch I was able to cook up some good fried rice outside on the flattop.  I was even prepped from the day before with a good set of fridge stale rice.  Turned out great and we enjoyed it together.
