A new completion plugin that I might give a try.  Readme makes it sound like its built on some fast teck that allows them to handle a lot of items and run more frequently.  The videos look like they don't have some of the same issues cmp does for me.  Maybe its my configuration, but I'm pretty sure it does not update when you backspace and things like that.
