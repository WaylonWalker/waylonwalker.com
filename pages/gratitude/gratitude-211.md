Today was a chill Saturday, time with family, mowing done.  Nothing super
special.  While not exciting I am grateful for them, sometimes chill days are
few and far between and life really gets to be a rat race (struggling to think
of the right phrase off the cuff).  Exciting days are good, but come at a cost
when they are too many.  Oh we did go on a bike ride with Dobby, that was great
too.
