> Inspiring story transitioning into tech from nursing.  I also came to tech through a set of circumstances that made it difficult for me to excel at my current job.  Looking back it is something that I was always interested in and I was just unsure how to get in, I am so glad that I figured it out, it has been such a great benefit to my family.

I really enjoyed listening to trshpuppy's journey in through building projects, and choosing tech not based on what she wanted to learn, but what fit the project the best.
