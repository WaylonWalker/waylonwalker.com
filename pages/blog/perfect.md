Perfect is a made up word that humans use to describe something that is above
average, or works really well for them.  The idea of perfection is fleeting, as
you think more deeply about somthing, you can continue to chase the idea of
perfection to unimaginable senses.  Sometimes _perfect_ simply means _good
enough_.  Could there be something better, **Always**, but at what cost.  If I
spent 10 more minutes on this post would it be better, maybe, but I might fuck
it up.  If I spent my lifetime studying how humans read and think, soley
focused on how it pertains to this post, ya it would get better.
