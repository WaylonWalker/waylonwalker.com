[shreyashankar](https://github.com/shreyashankar) has done a fantastic job with [gpt3-sandbox](https://github.com/shreyashankar/gpt3-sandbox). Highly recommend taking a look.

The goal of this project is to enable users to create cool web demos using the newly released OpenAI GPT-3 API with just a few lines of Python.
