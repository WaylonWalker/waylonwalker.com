Today I was playing with markdown split panels.  I want to be able to compare
and constrast occasionually, today the inspiration hit to do this using
admonitions.

    You will need to rotate your device to see the side by side feature.

## The Markdown

This is what I am going for, one admonition that is easy to remember, that
nests inside of itself , and I can put as much markdown on the inside that I
want.

``` markdown
!!! vsplit I Have two opinions

    !!! vsplit Left Opinion

        supporting arguments

        * lorem ipsum
        * ipsum dolor

        - [x] lorem ipsum
        - [ ] ipsum dolor

    !!! vsplit Right Opinion

        supporting arguments

        * lorem ipsum
        * ipsum dolor

        - [ ] lorem ipsum
        - [x] ipsum dolor
```

Here is the result of that markdown.

!!! vsplit I Have two opinions

    !!! vsplit Left Opinion

        supporting arguments

        * lorem ipsum
        * ipsum dolor

        - [x] lorem ipsum
        - [ ] ipsum dolor

    !!! vsplit Right Opinion

        supporting arguments

        * lorem ipsum
        * ipsum dolor

        - [ ] lorem ipsum
        - [x] ipsum dolor

{.clean}
!!! vsplit ""

    !!! vsplit Hello World

        Here is a hello world application written in the typer cli framework
        for cli.


    !!! vsplit ""

        ``` python
        #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --quiet --script
        # ///
        # requires-python = ">=3.12"
        # dependencies = [
        #     "typer",
        # ]
        # ///

        import typer

        app = typer.Typer()

        @app.command()
        def hello(name: str = "World"):
            """Prints a greeting message."""
            typer.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app()
        ```
