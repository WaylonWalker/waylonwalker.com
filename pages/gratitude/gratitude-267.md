title: Gratitude 267

Today I got some really good feedback at work, I just looked it up, and it's
called a covert compliment.  It was the opposite of a backhanded compliment (an
insult disguised as a compliment).  The guy did not really intend it, but the
comments made proved a lot is going in the right direction.  I am grateful to
have the respect of this community, that I am somehow someone of importance and
meaning, and most of all able to bring something very meaningful to the table.
It shocks me how I got here with just hard persistent work, yet somehow stay
ahead of the curve.  I magically fell into a role where the work interests me
and it makes it easy to learn and keep going.
