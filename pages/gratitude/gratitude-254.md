Big trip back to the homeland today to spend with the inlaws.  Grandma wanted a
get together of all the cousins and great grandchildren.  It's a bit of a
stretch, long day in the car both ways, but spending time with everyone was
great.  Some we have not seen in a long time, new babies we have not met.
Overall great trip, our kids had fun there and were happy to bond with family.
