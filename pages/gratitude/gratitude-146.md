We got the appraisal back on our house today.  It came in a bit under,
and we are going to need to bring some cash to the closing, but it's ok
it was not over our budget.  We will get out of here and in there before
our lease here expires, but it might limit some of the things that we
are able to do with it.  I am just excited that we are moving forward,
and do not need to be in the middle of this mess for a long time.
Hopefully for a REALLY long time, we have moved WAY too often over the
course of my 12 years being out of my parents house, I'm pretty sure
that I have held 11 different addresses over those years, its time for
that to slow down big time.
