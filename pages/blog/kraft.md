Kraft is the family gaming server that we started early 2025.

## Repopulating

Villagers are really hard to get gong.  We have this huge villager tower on the
server, we nearly every bed filled, and one day we logged in and there were
three.  Not sure what happened until I witnessed one of them jump maybe 3
blocks down and off himself.  I checked my last two villagers and they were
each on one or two hearts left.  We almost lost every single villager on the
server.

To get villagers to breed and make baby villagers you need beds, which we
already have, and food.  I gave my guys some food and they started making baby
villagers immediately, crisis averted as we start to get the first few fresh
full health villagers on the server.
