Tonight Wyatt and I had a good chunk of time just the two of us.  We worked on
so many different projects as one does when spending time with the neurospicy.
We put up 2 full sheets of drywall (4 halves) for Rhiannon's wall.  He was such
a help, telling me which side of the wall we were missing screws on, stud
finding, holding heavy sheets of drywall to get the first screws in.  We both
worked on games in pygame.  We watched some bossfighrs from undertale, which I
have never played so spoilers for me.  oddly enough we didn't even play any
games.
