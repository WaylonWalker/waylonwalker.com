> This looks like great prototyping tool for k8s. I too often ask ai to get me going with the things I need.  I've used k8s long enough that I can generally remember all the things I need, roughly where they go, would probably forget a few things and need to iterate, but I cannot remember exactly what goes where and need examples at a minimum.  I need to give this a go from desktop and see if it will work for me.  Right now looking through mobile looks promising.
