I like [RanaEmad's](https://github.com/RanaEmad) project [metrics-of-awesome-api](https://github.com/RanaEmad/metrics-of-awesome-api).

A Node.js API with the main purpose of acting as a backend for practicing authentication in React. It enables the user to sign up, sign in and view a dashboard with his metrics of awesome through different endpoints.
