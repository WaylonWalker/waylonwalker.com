For far too long I have had to fidget with v4l2oloopback after reboot.  I've
had this happen on ubuntu 18.04, 22.04, and arch.

After a reboot the start virtual camera button won't work, It appears and is
clickable, but never turns on.  Until I run this command.

``` bash
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=10 card_label="OBS Video Source" exclusive_caps=1
```

Today I learned that you can turn on kernel modules through some files in `/etc/modules...`

This is what I did to my arch system to get it to work right after boot.

``` bash
echo "v4l2loopback" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/v4l2loopback.conf
echo "options v4l2loopback video_nr=10 card_label=\"OBS Video Source\" exclusive_caps=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf
```
